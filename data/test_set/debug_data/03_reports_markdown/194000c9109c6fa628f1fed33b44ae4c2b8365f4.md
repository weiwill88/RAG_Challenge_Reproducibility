## Business Strategy


Our  vision  is  to  be  the  most  compelling  and  inclusive  platform  for  automotive  enthusiasts,  to  inspire  and  support  enthusiasts'  transition  to cleaner, more sustainable technologies, and to further accelerate the automotive lifestyle. Our aim is to provide a platform where automotive enthusiasts can purchase aftermarket auto parts for both old model restorations and new vehicle enhancements. We believe our consumers are enthusiastic and passionate about the performance and the personalization of their classic and modern cars. We aim to provide the products and service they need to pursue that passion. We will continue to drive growth and value for our shareholders through our key strategies:
- · Continuous  New  Product  Development: New  products  allow  us  to  increase  market  share  in  existing  categories,  extend  into adjacent categories, capture new enthusiast consumers and extend or further penetrate new vehicle platforms.

We believe that our scalable business platform, relationships with our distribution and channel partners, strong loyalty with our growing consumer base, and experienced management team and board of directors, position us to realize the benefits from the integration of recent acquisitions and prime us for future acquisitions.

## Competition

The performance automotive industry is highly competitive, and we face substantial competition in all the markets that we serve. The principal factors  on  which  industry  participants  compete  include  technical  features,  performance,  product  design,  innovation,  reliability  and  durability, brand, time to market, customer service, reliable order execution, and price. Our success in the marketplace depends on our ability to execute our Business Strategy discussed above.

The performance automotive aftermarket parts industry in the United States is large and highly fragmented. In addition, we have seen consistent growth within the automotive aftermarket parts industry over the last two decades. Products in the performance automotive aftermarket parts industry range from functional products that enhance vehicle performance to products that improve safety, stability, handling and appearance.

Our core competitive set is comprised of four primary types of competitors with fragmentation across the majority of our major product categories:
- · Multi-product  category  providers : legacy  brands  with  coverage  across  multiple  performance  aftermarket  products  with  multiple brands  often  under  one  banner  and  built  through  acquisition.  We  are  one  of  the  largest  multi-product  category  brands  in  the performance automotive aftermarket based on gross sales.
- · Single-product  category  providers :  established  companies  focused  on  one  product  category  in  the  market  primarily  selling  via resellers. Single-product category providers generally offer either lower priced products or higher-quality products focused within one product category.
- · E-Tailer Private Labels : traditional online resellers sell other manufactured products and offer private label products, often at a lower price  point.  E-tailer  private  labels  generally  occupy  the  value  end  of  the  market  and  have  a  greater  presence  in  less  engineered categories with less product-specific brand strength.
- · Niche custom manufacturers :  while  not  our  core  competitors, smaller shops typically focus on fully customizing specific make or model vehicles. Niche custom manufacturers are typically local or regionally focused, and some also may resell customized products from other manufactured brands.



We believe the following factors distinguish Holley from its competitors:
- · Brand that resonates with enthusiasts: we actively engage enthusiasts at the platform level across multiple channels (e.g., events, digital media, online communities, etc.), creating reference networks for potential consumers.
- · Innovative, product development: we invest heavily in product research, innovation and development, and introduce products that meet latest platform and use case-specific needs of our enthusiast consumers.
- · Operational  ability  that  enables  efficient  order  execution : we  make  significant  investments  in  sourcing,  manufacturing  and distribution excellence, enabling management of multiple product lines while maintaining scale and attractive relative pricing.
- · Differentiated  go-to-market  strategy :  we  offer  a  mix  of  single  product  and  platform-oriented  solutions  across  DTC  and  reseller channels, delivering a strong overall consumer experience.



## Brands

We have a strong portfolio of brands covering various product categories. Our portfolio consists of over 70 brands spanning across 30 product categories. Our top seven brands generated 68% of our sales in 2022.

## Product Development

We offer our enthusiast consumers a comprehensive suite of performance automotive aftermarket products to meet a wide range of needs. We are continuously innovating and evolving our product offerings to meet ever-changing consumer needs. We invest heavily in developing new products, spending an average of $20.5 million per year on research and development since 2017   We believe our product development . capabilities will enable us to create sustainable long-term growth and margin enhancements for our business.

We have a history of developing innovative products, including new products in existing categories like Electronic Fuel Injection, product line expansions, and products that bring us into new markets including components for converting ICE vehicles to electric powertrains. We have thoughtfully expanded our product portfolio over time to adapt to consumer needs and find solutions to new consumer demands. We expand our existing product families and enter new product categories by creating solutions grounded in our expert insights and relevant market knowledge. We believe we have a meaningful runway across our target product categories and product vintages, and we are well positioned for future growth by expanding in adjacent and transformational categories that present opportunities for further market penetration in the Performance Suspension,  Braking  and  Powertrain  Conversion  Systems  markets.  We  believe  there  are  also  opportunities  to  capitalize  on  growing  our powertrain agnostic categories like Automotive and Motorcycle Safety.


## Suppliers

We run a flexible sourcing model with a mix of global sourcing and in-house manufacturing. Our best value sourcing model decisions are based on a mix of cost, quality and service. We have a diverse global supplier base and no material supplier concentration. Our efficient sourcing model enables strong gross margins and cash conversion.

We believe there is an adequate supply of raw materials and key components; however, there can be no assurance over the long term that the availability of materials and components or increases in commodity prices will not materially affect our business or results of operations. Ongoing supply chain disruptions, resulting in supply shortages and higher shipping charges, have and could continue to impact our ability to maintain supplies of products and the costs associated with obtaining raw materials and key components. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions due to the global supply shortage of automotive-grade microchips, which has resulted in increased microchip delivery lead times.


## Marketing

We reach and engage our consumers where they participate in the performance automotive aftermarket - online and in person. Our marketing strategy  is  centered  on  strong  brand  equity,  leading  new  product  innovation  capabilities  and  delivering  consistently  high-quality  products.  In 2022, we spent approximately $11.6 million (or approximately 2% of our 2022 annual gross sales) on marketing and advertising. Going forward, consistent with our value creation strategies, we intend to continue our investments in direct consumer marketing and advertising as well as refocus our current mix of spending towards activities believed to generate the highest return on investment. We believe these strategies will have a meaningfully positive impact across our brand portfolio.

In  recent  years,  we  have  shifted  our  marketing  efforts  towards  digital  advertising  and  have  increased  investments  in  consumer  engagement directly via digital and social media platforms and campaigns. Additionally, since mid-2020 we increased resources focused on expanding our ecommerce and digital platforms. These efforts have included turning Holley.com into a destination for automotive enthusiasts and launching Motor Life, our internal digital publication that is available to the public on our website. As a result, we have experienced a significant increase in social media and online engagement since that time. Continued expansion of and investment in digital and social media are expected in the future, including focusing on strategies to grow the high margin DTC channel.

We have also spent significant time and effort in creating engaging, in-person events to build the Holley tribe. These events focus on creating memorable experiences for enthusiasts, celebrate car culture, build community and show enthusiasts how Holley products can help them enjoy their vehicles. Since 2015, our events have grown in total annual attendance from 14,000 to106,000 in2022  We currently host seven annual . self-funding events, including LS Fest East, LS Fest West, Ford Fest, MoParty, High Voltage, Brother's Truck Show, plus a new event launched in 2022, LS Fest Texas, our largest inaugural event to date.


## Sales and Distribution

We have  a  diverse  omni-channel  distribution  strategy  led  by  our  growing  DTC  channel.  Our  omni-channel  model  enables  us  to  reach  our consumers  through  DTC,  E-tailer,  warehouse  distributor,  traditional  retailer,  and  jobber/  installer  channels.  We  have  mutually  beneficial relationships  with  our  resellers  and  are  able  to  maintain  strong  pricing  discipline  across  our  channels  with  strict  conformance  to  minimum advertised pricing.

DTC channel : Consumers are increasingly meeting us online through our DTC channel. Our DTC channel provides consumers full access to all of  our  brands,  our  unique  branded  content  and  our  full  product  assortment.  We  have  turned  Holley.com  into  our  primary  hub  for  consumer communication and continue to add features and brands that make it an increasingly attractive digital destination for our consumers. Our DTC channel enables us to directly interact with our customers, more effectively control our brand experience, better understand consumer behavior and preferences, and offer exclusive products, content, and customization capabilities. We believe our control over our DTC channel provides our customers with quality brand engagement and further builds customer loyalty, while generating attractive margins.

Resellers : We have historically sold the majority of our products through resellers who purchase our products and resell them through various channels. These resellers consist of E-tailers,  warehouse distributors,  traditional  retailers,  and  jobber/installers  with  E-tailers  and  warehouse distributors accounting for 60% of our sales in 2022, and our top ten resellers accounting for 39% of our sales in 2022 with our largest reseller making up 19% of our sales in 2022.

We have established mutually beneficial and long-term relationships with our resellers.  We  believe  resellers  benefit  from  our  broad  suite  of product offerings that they can leverage to meet consumer demand across multiple product categories. Based on the value that we offer to our resellers,  we  are  able  to  operate  with  pricing  discipline  that  supports  the  value  of  our  products  in  the  marketplace  and  buttresses  our  profit margins. We believe our approach to pricing allows us to better understand consumer demand and identify what our end consumers are buying.


## Intellectual Property

Patents,  trademarks,  and  other  proprietary  rights  are  important  to  the  continued  success  of  our  business.  We  own  and  have  licensing arrangements for a number of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, and other proprietary rights related to our products and business. We also rely  upon  continuing  technological  innovation  and  licensing  opportunities  to  develop  and  maintain  our  competitive  position.  We  protect  our proprietary  rights  through  a  variety  of  methods,  including  the  use  of  confidentiality  and  other  similar  agreements.  We  do  not  consider  our business to be dependent on any single patent, nor is the expiration of any patent expected to materially affect our business. Our current patents will expire over various periods and we continue to file new patent applications on newly developed technology. From time to time, we become aware of potential infringement of our patent, trademark, or other proprietary rights, and we investigate instances of alleged infringement where we believe it is merited and take appropriate actions under applicable intellectual property laws in response to such infringements where we determine it is valuable to do so. Similarly, from time to time we are the subject of intellectual property and other proprietary rights related suits and other litigation.


## Seasonality

Holley's operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control. Traditionally, our sales in the first half of the year are generally higher than in the second half of the year. Due to these factors and others, which may be unknown to the Company at this time, operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate. Accordingly, the Company's historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance.


## Regulations

We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution. These permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all material environmental laws and regulations applicable to our  plants  and  operations.  Historically,  our  annual  costs  of  achieving  and  maintaining  compliance  with  environmental,  health  and  safety requirements have not been material to our financial results.

Increasing global efforts to control emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrogen oxide and other greenhouse gases and pollutants, as well  as  the  shifting  focus  of  regulatory  efforts  towards  total  emissions  output,  have  the  potential  to  impact  our  facilities,  costs,  products  and customers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ('EPA') has taken action to control greenhouse gases from certain stationary and mobile sources.  In  addition,  several  states  have  taken  steps,  such  as  adoption  of  cap-and-trade  programs  or  other  regulatory  systems,  to  address greenhouse  gases. There  have  also  been  international  efforts  seeking  legally  binding  reductions  in  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases.  These developments and further actions that may be taken in the U.S. and in other countries, states or provinces could affect our operations both positively and negatively (e.g., by affecting the demand for or suitability of some of our products).

We also may be subject to liability as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and similar state or foreign laws for contaminated properties that we currently own, lease or operate or that we or our predecessors have previously owned, leased or operated, and sites to which we or our predecessors sent hazardous substances. Such liability may be joint and several so that we may be liable for more than our share of any contamination, and any such liability may be determined without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. We or our predecessors have been named potentially responsible parties at contaminated sites from time to time. We do not anticipate any potential liability relating to contaminated sites to be material to our financial results.


## Employees

Holley's employees are integral to our strategic growth and success. We consider our team members to be our most valuable asset and seek to attract and maintain the highest quality talent by offering competitive benefits and wellness services, opportunities to grow professionally, and regular evaluations, among other initiatives. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 1,622 full-time employees and 100 temporary employees. Approximately 48% of our full-time employees are based primarily in our Bowling Green, KY headquarters, distribution center and manufacturing plants. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or represented by a labor union. We believe our facilities are in labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of skilled and unskilled workers, and we believe our relations with our employees are good.

Many  of  our  employees  are  automotive  enthusiasts.  We  pride  ourselves  on  having  a  platform  built  for  enthusiasts  by  enthusiasts.  As  of December  2022,  our  Engineering  function  includes  approximately  203  employees,  including  many  enthusiast-focused  engineers  who  are passionate about cars. We continue to seek out top level talent that will help accomplish our mission and vision moving forward. Our goal is to create an inclusive and safe environment for our employees that keeps them engaged in their work.

Compensation and Benefits .  We strive to hire, develop and retain top talent. We attract and reward our employees by providing competitive benefits, including market-competitive compensation, medical, dental and vision insurance, short-term and long-term disability insurance, basic life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, voluntary supplemental coverages, flexible spending accounts, paid time off, and our 401(k) program. Holley matches employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to 3.5% each pay period, and an additional discretionary match of up to 1.5% is made based on company performance to targets.

Health,  Safety  and  Wellness .  Holley  is  committed  to  the  health  and  well-being  of  its  employees  and  designs  its  compensation  and  benefit programs to demonstrate this commitment. Our programs are intended to support the physical and mental well-being of our employees and their families by providing the tools and resources for employees to improve or maintain their health and to lessen concerns about missing work and the potential financial impact.

Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our top priorities. We have implemented programs and training designed to eliminate workplace incidents, risks and hazards. The core training provided includes Emergency Response, OSHA Reporting, Fire Safety, and Office Ergonomics. We also review and monitor our performance closely. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we followed guidance from the Centers for  Disease  Control,  the  World  Health  Organization,  and  the  various  states  and  counties  in  which  we  operate  in  order  to  keep  our employees safe. We will continue to make the health and wellbeing of our employees a priority.

Inclusion .  We  know  that  diversity  throughout  our  company  creates  stronger  teams,  leads  to  innovation,  and  results  in  an  organization  that provides the best service to our customers. We have a recruitment strategy that encourages diversity across the company. We leverage our employee referral program to identify diverse talent during the recruitment process. We also engage with a local development board and a local refugee center in Bowling Green, KY to increase our diverse talent candidate pool.

We believe our employees should reflect the customers we serve. Notably, approximately 30% of Holley consumers are female. Accordingly, we recognize the benefits of female representation in our workforce, and in 2022 over 30% of our workforce were women. We are committed to closing the gender gap and our recruitment and retention strategies support improving women's representation in leadership roles.

Our Culture . At Holley, we believe that an engaged workforce leads to a more innovative, productive, and profitable organization. For this reason, we measure employee engagement through periodic culture surveys. These surveys allow our employees to provide confidential feedback on culture, company strategy and trust in their direct leaders. This feedback helps create action plans to improve the engagement of our employees. These survey results have demonstrated that our employees have a strong sense of belonging, trust in management, and confidence in Holley. These strengths provide a foundation for our success, and we are dedicated to enhancing the employee experience at Holley.

Talent Development . The development of our employees' skills and knowledge is critical to Holley's success.

Our educational assistance program is designed to encourage personal development by helping employees maintain and improve their skills or knowledge related to their current job or a potential future position at Holley through reimbursement of certain educational expenses, including external training programs or educational courses, pursuit and maintenance of job-related professional licenses and certifications, workshops, seminars, and professional conferences. Further, we are introducing an internship program designed to provide students in the community an opportunity to gain practical experience. We are committed to fostering an equitable work environment that seeks to ensure fair treatment, equality of opportunity, and fairness in access to information and resources.

Social Responsibility . We are committed to social responsibility. Our socially responsible initiatives include donations to community organizations, sponsorship of local sports teams and weekend family events. Through these programs, Holley and its employees are able to give back to the community through monetary donations and by providing community services. Holley gives its subsidiaries the ability to lead their own community engagement initiatives through contributions to charities and participation in fundraising events.

## Item 1A. Risk Factors

The following  discussion  of  "Risk  Factors"  identifies  factors  that  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  operations,  financial  condition  or  future performance. This information should be read in conjunction with 'Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, ' "Management s ' Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition  and  Result  of  Operations"  and  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  related  notes.  The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the material factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements.


## Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry

Unfavorable economic conditions could have an adverse impact on consumer discretionary spending and therefore adversely impact our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Our products are largely recreational in nature and are therefore discretionary purchases for consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases of automotive products during favorable economic conditions and when consumers are feeling confident and prosperous. Discretionary spending is also affected by many other factors, including general business conditions, inflation, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxes, and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Purchases of our products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, or during periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. A significant or prolonged decline  in  general  economic  conditions  or  uncertainties  regarding  future  economic  prospects  that  adversely  affect  consumer  discretionary spending, whether in the United States or in our international markets, could result in reduced sales of our products, which in turn would have an adverse impact on our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations.


## Inflation could result in higher costs and decreased profitability.

Rising inflation may continue to adversely affect us by increasing the cost of raw materials. Our products contain various raw materials, including corrosion-resistant steel, non-ferrous metals such as aluminum and nickel, and precious metals such as platinum and palladium. We use raw materials directly in manufacturing and in components that we purchase from our suppliers. We generally purchase components with significant raw material content on the open market. Volatility in the prices of raw materials such as steel, aluminum and nickel could continue to increase the cost of manufacturing our products. In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases, in other cases, they cannot. Recent inflationary pressures and other factors have also resulted in significant increases in transportation and freight service  costs  due  to  limited  capacity  and/or  availability  of  containers,  shipping  vessels,  and/or  receiving  port  services.  If  the  prices  of  raw material and other inputs increase, and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.

# Page 12

# Table of Contents

Many of the markets in which we sell have been experiencing high levels of inflation, which may depress consumer demand for our products and reduce our profitability. Even in the event that increased costs can be passed through to customers, our gross margin percentages may decline. Additionally, our suppliers are also subject to fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and may attempt to pass all or a portion of such increases on to us. In the event they are successful in doing so, our margins would decline. If prolonged, and if they cannot be passed on to customers in the  form  of  price  increases,  these  fluctuations  in  the  price  of  raw  materials,  product  components,  other  inputs,  and/or  transportation services could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations.


## Disruptions of supply or shortages of raw materials or components used in our products could harm our business and profitability.

We have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions and higher costs in manufacturing, supply chain, logistical operations, and shortages of steel, non-ferrous metals and precious metals. Additionally, we have been adversely impacted by the global supply shortage of automotive-grade microchips. This shortage has resulted in increased microchip delivery lead times, delays in production and increased costs to source available automotive-grade microchips. If our supply of these products continues to be adversely affected, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate replacements for the existing components or that supplies will be available on terms and prices that are favorable to us, if at all.

Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in supply costs and disruptions in the supply chain due to factors beyond our control. We have taken steps to minimize the adverse impacts of supply chain volatility and rising inflation by implementing cost savings initiatives, increasing prices to customers, increasing inventory levels of certain products, and working closely with our suppliers and customers to minimize disruptions in delivering products to customers. Despite the actions we have undertaken to minimize these impacts, there can be no assurance that unforeseen future events in the global supply chain and our ability to pass on inflationary costs to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


## Current  global  economic  conditions,  including  inflation  and  supply  chain  disruptions,  could  continue  to  adversely  affect  our distributors  financial condition, their levels of business activity and their ability to pay trade obligations. '

We primarily sell our products to retailers directly and through our domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and to foreign distributors. We generally require no collateral from our customers. However, if the current economic conditions and macroeconomic trends, including heightened inflation, capital  market  volatility,  and  interest  rate  fluctuations,  continue,  our  results  of  operations  may  be  adversely  affected.  These  disruptions  and delays have strained certain domestic and international supply chains, which have affected and could continue to adversely affect the flow or availability of certain products or components. As a result, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, disruptions and higher costs in manufacturing, supply chain, logistical operations, and shortages of certain of our products in distribution channels.

A prolonged or severe downturn in the general economy could adversely affect the retail market, which in turn, would adversely impact the liquidity and cash flows of our customers, including the ability of such customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and to pay their trade obligations. This could result in increased delinquent or uncollectible accounts for some of our customers. A failure by our customers to pay on a timely basis a significant portion of outstanding account receivable balances would adversely impact our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations.


## A significant disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations.

A significant disruption at any of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers could materially and adversely affect our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. Our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are highly automated, which means that our operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, electronic or power interruptions, and other system failures, including failures caused by factors outside of our control, such as hostilities, political unrest,  terrorist  attacks,  war  (including  the  ongoing  conflict  in  Ukraine),  natural  disasters  or  extreme  weather  (including  events  that  may  be caused or exacerbated by climate change). Risks associated with upgrading or expanding these facilities may significantly disrupt or increase the cost of our operations, which may have an immediate, or in some cases prolonged, impact on our margins. Our risk management, business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of such disruptions, particularly in the case of catastrophic events or longer-term developments, such as the impacts of climate change.

A global pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to access current or obtain new lending facilities.


A  global  pandemic,  or  the  outbreak  of  a  disease,  such  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  could  adversely  affect  our  business.  The  preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate a pandemic may cause, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the United States, which could lead to a decline in discretionary spending by consumers, and in turn impact, possibly materially, our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. These impacts could include, but are not limited to:
- · the possibility of renewed retail store closures or reduced operating hours and/or decreased retail traffic;
- · disruption to our distribution centers and other vendors, including the effects of facility closures as a result of outbreaks of COVID-19 or measures taken by federal, state or local governments to reduce its spread, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages, and real time changes in operating procedures, including for additional cleaning and disinfection procedures; and
- · significant disruption of global financial markets, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to access capital in the future.


The outbreak of a different global pandemic, or the further spread of COVID-19, and the requirements to take action to help limit the spread of the illness,  could  impact  our  ability  to  carry  out  our  business  as  usual  and  may  materially  adversely  impact  global  economic  conditions,  our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. The extent of the impact of a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, on our business and financial results will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of such outbreak within the markets in which we operate,  the  related  impact  on  consumer  confidence  and  spending,  and  the  effect  of  governmental  regulations  imposed  in  response  to  the pandemic, all of which are highly uncertain and ever-changing. The duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted.


## Failure  to  compete  effectively  could  reduce  our  market  share  and  significantly  harm  our  business,  sales,  financial  condition  and results of operations.

Our industry is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to compete with suppliers of automotive aftermarket products, some of which  may  have  substantially  greater  financial,  marketing  and  other  resources  than  we  do.  Due  to  the  diversity  of  our  product  offering,  we compete  with  several  large  and  medium-sized  companies  and  a  large  number  of  smaller  regional  and  specialty  companies  and  numerous category-specific  competitors.  In  addition,  we  face  competition  from  original  equipment  manufacturers,  which,  through  their  automotive dealerships, supply many of the same types of replacement parts that we sell. Existing competitors may expand their product offerings and sales strategies, and new competitors may enter the market.


Some of our competitors may have larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to:
- · respond  more  quickly  than  we  can  to  new  or  emerging  technologies  and  changes  in  customer  requirements  by  devoting  greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of automotive aftermarket products;
- · engage in more extensive research and development; and
- · spend more money and resources on marketing and promotion.


Increased competition could put additional pressure on us to reduce prices or take other actions, which may have an adverse effect on our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. We may also lose significant customers or lines of business to competitors.


## If we are unable to successfully design, develop and market new products, our business may be harmed.

To  maintain  and  increase  sales,  we  must  continue  to  introduce  new  products  on  a  timely  basis  to  respond  to  new  and  evolving  consumer preferences and improve or enhance our existing products. The success of our new and enhanced products depends on many factors, including anticipating consumer preferences, finding innovative solutions to consumer problems, differentiating our products from those of our competitors, and maintaining the strength of our brands. The design and development of our products is costly, and we typically have several products in development at the  same  time.  Problems  in  the  design  or  quality  of  our  products,  or  delays  in  product  introduction,  may  harm  our  brands, business,  sales,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  Any  new  products  that  we  develop  and  market  may  not  generate  sufficient revenues to recoup our development, production, marketing, selling and other costs.

## A drive toward electric vehicles or away from vehicle ownership in general could impact our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations.

The  automotive  industry  is  increasingly  focused  on  the  development  of  hybrid  and  electric  vehicles  and  of  advanced  driver  assistance technologies, with the goal of developing and introducing a commercially viable, fully automated driving experience, and many manufacturers have announced plans to transition from internal- combustion engines into electric vehicle platforms over the coming years. There has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services, such as car and ride sharing, as opposed to automobile ownership, which may result in a long-term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita. Accordingly, if we do not continue to innovate and develop, or acquire, new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to original equipment manufacturer and consumer preferences, or if there is a future shift in consumer preferences towards ownership of more utilitarian vehicles or vehicles that are otherwise less interesting to a large portion of our customers who are automotive enthusiasts, or if there is otherwise a future shift away from automobile ownership among consumers in general, our and our subsidiaries' business, sales, financial condition and results of operations could be impacted.


## Our business depends on maintaining and strengthening our brands to generate and maintain ongoing demand for our products, and a significant reduction in such demand could harm our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Our success depends on the value and reputation of our brands, which, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality, design, performance, functionality, and durability of our products, the image of our e-commerce platform and retail partner floor spaces, our communication activities, including advertising, social media, and public relations, and our management of the customer experience, including direct interfaces through customer service. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brands are important to expanding our customer base, and will largely depend on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide consistent, high-quality customer experiences. We intend to continue  making  investments  in  these  areas  in  order  to  maintain  and  enhance  our  brands,  and  such  investments  may  not  be  successful. Ineffective marketing, negative publicity, product diversion to unauthorized distribution channels, product or manufacturing defects, counterfeit products,  unfair  labor  practices,  and  failure  to  protect  the  intellectual  property  rights  in  our  brands  are  some  of  the  potential  threats  to  the strength of our brands, and those and other factors could rapidly and severely diminish our relationships with customers and suppliers. These factors could cause our customers to lose the personal connection they feel with our brands and reduce our ability to attract new customers and lead  to  suppliers  terminating  their  relationships  with  us.  We  believe  that  maintaining  and  enhancing  the  image  of  our  brands  in  our  current markets and in new markets where we have limited brand recognition is important to expanding our customer base. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brands in current or new markets, our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.


## If  we  inaccurately  forecast  demand for our products, we may manufacture either insufficient or excess quantities, which, in either case, could adversely affect our financial performance.

We plan our manufacturing capacity based upon the forecasted demand for our products. Forecasting the demand for our products is very difficult  given  the  manufacturing  lead  time  and  the  amount  of  specification  involved  especially  given  the  volatility  of  the  markets  and  the economic downturn, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, forecasting demand for specific automotive parts can also be challenging due to changing consumer preferences and competitive pressures and longer supply lead times. The nature of our business makes it difficult to quickly adjust our manufacturing capacity if actual demand for our products varies  from  forecasted  demand.  If  actual  demand  for  our  products  exceeds  forecasted  demand,  we  may  not  be  able  to  produce  sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand, which could limit our sales and adversely affect our financial performance. On the other  hand,  if  actual  demand  is  less  than  forecasted  demand  for  our  products,  we  could  produce  excess  quantities,  resulting  in  excess inventories and related obsolescence charges that could adversely affect our financial performance.


## We may not be able to effectively manage our growth.

As we grow our business, slower growing or reduced demand for our products, increased competition, a decrease in the growth rate of our overall market, failure to develop and successfully market new products, or the maturation of our business or markets could harm our business. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in our research and development and sales and marketing organizations, expand our operations and infrastructure both domestically and internationally, design and develop new products, and enhance our existing products. If our sales do not increase at a sufficient rate to offset these increases in our operating expenses, our profitability may decline in future periods.

We only have a limited history operating our business as a public company at its current scale. Consequently, if our operations grow at a rapid pace in the future, we may experience difficulties in managing this growth and building the appropriate processes and controls. Future rapid growth  may  increase  the  strain  on  our  resources,  and  we  could  experience  operating  difficulties,  including  difficulties  in  sourcing,  logistics, recruiting,  maintaining internal controls, marketing, designing innovative products, and meeting consumer needs. If we do not adapt to meet these evolving challenges, the strength of our brands may erode, the quality of our products may suffer, we may not be able to deliver products on a timely basis to our customers, and our corporate culture may be harmed.

We have set certain growth initiatives for our business to meet long-term strategic objectives and improve stockholder value. We may incur certain costs to achieve our growth initiatives, and we may not meet anticipated implementation timetables or stay within budgeted costs. As these  growth  initiatives  are  undertaken,  we  may  not  achieve  our  expected  results,  which  could  adversely  impact  our  customer  retention  or results of operation.


## If we fail to attract new customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, we may not be able to increase sales.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract customers in a cost-effective manner. In order to expand our customer base, we must appeal to and attract customers ranging from automotive enthusiasts to individuals who simply value products of uncompromising quality and design.  We  have  made,  and  expect  to  continue  to  make,  significant  investments  in  attracting  new  customers,  including  through  the  use  of traditional, digital, and social media and participation in, and sponsorship of, community events. Marketing campaigns can be expensive and may not result in the cost-effective acquisition of customers. Further, as our brands become more widely known, future marketing campaigns may not attract new customers at the same rate as past campaigns. If we are unable to attract new customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, our growth could be slower than we expect, and our business may be harmed.


## Our growth depends, in part, on expanding into additional consumer markets, and we may not be successful in doing so.

We believe that our future growth depends not only on continuing to reach our current core demographic, but also continuing to broaden our retail partner and customer bases. The growth of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to expand our retail partner and customer bases in the United States, as well as in international markets. In these markets, we may face challenges that are different from those we currently  encounter,  including  competitive,  merchandising,  distribution,  hiring,  and  other  difficulties.  We  may  also  encounter  difficulties  in attracting customers due to a lack of consumer familiarity with or acceptance of our brands, or a resistance to paying for premium products, particularly  in  international  markets.  We  continue  to  evaluate  marketing  efforts  and  other  strategies  to  expand  the  customer  base  for  our products. In addition, although we are investing in sales and marketing activities to further penetrate newer regions, including expansion of our dedicated sales force, we cannot ensure that we will be successful. If we are not successful, our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.


## Competitors have attempted, and will likely continue to attempt to, imitate our products and technology. If we are unable to protect or preserve the image of our brands and proprietary rights, our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.

As our business continues to expand, our competitors have imitated or attempted to imitate, and will likely continue to imitate or attempt to imitate, our product designs and branding, which could harm our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. Only a portion of the intellectual property used in the manufacture and design of our products is patented, and we, therefore, rely significantly on trade secrets, trade and service marks, trade dress, and the strength of our brands. We regard our patents, trade dress, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and  similar  proprietary  rights  as  critical  to  our  success.  We  also  rely  on  trade  secret  protection  and  confidentiality  agreements  with  our employees, consultants, suppliers, manufacturers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Nevertheless, the steps we take to protect our proprietary  rights  against  infringement  or  other  violations  may  be  inadequate,  and  we  may  experience  difficulty  in  effectively  limiting  the unauthorized  use  of  our  patents,  trademarks,  trade  dress,  and  other  intellectual  property  and  proprietary  rights  worldwide.  We  also  cannot guarantee that others will not independently develop technology with the same or similar function to any proprietary technology that we rely on to conduct our business and differentiate our self from our competitors. Unauthorized use or invalidation of our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade dress, trade secrets, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights may cause significant damage to our brands and harm our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations.

# Table of Contents

While we actively develop and protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected in all countries in which we conduct our business or that we will prevail when defending our patent, trademark, and proprietary rights. Additionally, we could  incur  significant  costs  and  management  distraction  in  pursuing  claims  to  enforce  our  intellectual  property  rights  through  litigation  and defending any alleged counterclaims. If we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our patents, trade dress, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights for any reason, or if we fail to maintain the image of our brands due to actual or perceived product or service quality issues, adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, or other reasons, our brands and reputation could be damaged, and our business may be harmed.


## Our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on pricing.

Our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including unfavorable economic conditions, intense competition, consolidation  in  the  retail  industry,  pressure  from  retailers  to  reduce  the  costs  of  products,  and  changes  in  consumer  demand.  The  current economic  conditions  and  macroeconomic  trends,  including  heightened  inflation,  capital  market  volatility,  interest  rate  and  current  rate fluctuations,  have  had  and  may  continue  to  have  an  impact  on  pricing.  These  factors  may  cause  us  to  reduce  our  prices  to  retailers  and customers or engage in more promotional activity than we anticipate, which could adversely impact our margins and cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. This could materially harm our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, ongoing and sustained promotional activities could harm the image of our brands.


## Our current and future products may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in negative publicity, litigation, product recalls, and warranty claims, which could result in decreased sales and operating margin, and harm to our brand.

Although we extensively and rigorously test new and enhanced products, there can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all defects. Defects in materials or components can unexpectedly interfere with the products' intended use and safety and damage our reputation. Failure to detect, prevent, or fix defects could result in a variety of consequences, including a greater number of product returns than expected from customers and retail partners, litigation, product recalls, and credit claims, among others, which could harm our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. The occurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in our current and future products could  expose  us  to  product  recalls,  warranty,  or  other  claims.  In  addition,  any  negative  publicity  or  lawsuits  filed  against  us  related  to  the perceived quality and safety of our products could also harm our brand and decrease demand for our products.


## Our reliance on foreign suppliers for some of the automotive parts we sell to our customers or include in our products presents risks to the business .


A portion of automotive parts and components we use in our manufacturing processes are imported from suppliers located outside the U.S. As a result, we are subject to various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing products from abroad, and these risks may become heightened as a result of unfavorable global economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19. These risks may include, but are not limited to:
- · shortages of key component parts used in our products sourced from non-U.S. suppliers;
- · increased transportation costs;
- · significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to port security considerations;
- · imposition of duties, taxes, tariffs or other charges on imports;
- · potential recalls or cancellations of orders for any product that does not meet our quality standards;
- · disruption of imports by labor disputes or strikes and local business practices;
- · heightened  terrorism  security  concerns,  which  could  subject  imported  goods  to  additional,  more  frequent  or  more  thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods;
- · political tensions, conflicts, and wars, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine;
- · natural disasters, disease, epidemics and health related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;
- · inability of our non-U.S. suppliers to obtain adequate credit or access liquidity to finance their operations; and
- · our ability or inability to enforce any agreements with our foreign suppliers.


Any of the foregoing factors, or a combination of them, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us and materially and adversely impact our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations.

## We depend on retail partners to display and present our products to customers, and our failure to maintain and further develop our relationships with retail partners could harm our business.

We sell  a  significant  amount  of  our  products  through  knowledgeable  national,  regional,  and  independent  retail  partners.  Our  retail  partners service customers by stocking and displaying our products, explaining the attributes of our products, and sharing the story of our brands. Our relationships with these retail partners are important to the authenticity of our brands and the marketing programs we continue to deploy. Our failure  to  maintain  these  relationships  with  our  retail  partners  or  financial  difficulties  experienced  by  these  retail  partners  could  harm  our business.

We have key relationships with national retail partners. If we lose any of our key retail partners or any key retail partner reduces their purchases of our existing or new products or their number of stores or operations, or promotes products of our competitors over ours, our sales would be harmed. Because Holley is a premium brand, our sales depend, in part, on retail partners effectively displaying our products, including providing attractive space and point of purchase displays in their stores, and training their sales personnel to sell our products. If our retail partners reduce or  terminate  those  activities,  we  may  experience  reduced  sales  of  our  products,  resulting  in  lower  gross  margins,  which  would  harm  our business, financial condition and results of operations.


## If  our  plans  to  increase  sales  through  our  DTC  channel are not successful, our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.

For 2022, we generated through our DTC channel approximately $149.1 million in gross sales. Part of our growth strategy involves increasing sales through our DTC channel. The level of customer traffic and volume of customer purchases through our website is substantially dependent on our ability to provide a content-rich and user-friendly website, a hassle-free customer experience, sufficient product availability, and reliable, timely  delivery  of  our  products.  If  we  are  unable  to  maintain  and  increase  customers'  use  of  our  website,  allocate  sufficient  product  to  our website, and increase any sales through our website, our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.


## Our future success depends on the continuing efforts of our management and key employees, and on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and senior management.

We depend on the talents and continued efforts of our senior management and key employees. The loss of members of management or key employees may disrupt our business and harm our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our ability to manage further expansion will require us to continue to attract, motivate, and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for this type of personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting, integrating, and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business effectively. There can be no assurance that our current management team or any new members of the management team will be able to successfully execute our business and operating strategies.


## Our results of operations may be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover and labor cost increases.

An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation, increase in federal or state minimum wages, or increase in general labor costs, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. During 2021, the country experienced an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market, and the labor market remained competitive throughout 2022. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, caused by worsening economic conditions, increases in labor costs or the COVID-19 pandemic or other national or international emergencies, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased salaries and wage rates to attract and retain employees. Further, labor shortages or increased turnover rates could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our business if we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we take to respond to a decrease  in  labor  availability  have  unintended  negative  consequences.  If  we  are  unable  to  hire  or  retain  skilled  personnel  our  results  of operations would suffer.

We rely on complex information systems for management of our manufacturing, distribution, sales and other functions. If our information systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if we experience an interruption in our operations, including a breach in cyber security, our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.


All of our major operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and accounting, are dependent upon our complex information systems. Our information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:
- · earthquake, fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters;
- · power loss, computer systems failure, Internet and telecommunications or data network failure; and
- · hackers, computer viruses, ransomware and other malware, software bugs or glitches.


Any damage or significant disruption in the operation of such systems, the failure of our information systems to perform as expected, the failure to  successfully integrate the information technology systems of the businesses that we have recently acquired or any security breach to the information systems (including financial or credit/payment frauds) would disrupt our business, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory and product shortages and otherwise adversely affect our reputation, operations, financial performance and condition.

Our information systems are subject to security threats and sophisticated cyber-based attacks, including, but not limited to, denial-of-service attacks, hacking, 'phishing' attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, or physical breaches, that can cause deliberate or unintentional damage, create system disruptions, unauthorized acquisition of our or customer information,  or  destruction  or  misuse,  manipulation,  denial  of  access  to  or  disclosure  of  confidential  or  important  information.  We  have experienced, and expect to continue to confront, efforts by hackers and other third parties to gain unauthorized access or deny access to, or otherwise disrupt, our information systems. For example, we were the target of an external cyber-attack in 2021, which resulted in a temporary suspension  of  services  to  our  customers.  To  date  these  incidents  have  not  had  a  material  impact  on  our  reputation,  operations,  financial performance and condition; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future, and such incidents have in the past  and  may  in  the  future  have  the  impacts  discussed  below.  Any  future  successful  cyber-attack  or  catastrophic  natural  disaster  could significantly affect our operating and financial systems and could temporarily disrupt our ability to provide services to our customers, impact our ability to manage our operations and perform vital financial processes, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.

Moreover,  the  threat  of  cyber-attacks  is  constantly  evolving,  thereby  increasing  the  difficulty  of  successfully  defending  against  them  or implementing adequate preventative measures and we cannot ensure that we will be able to identify, prevent or contain the effects of future cyber-attacks or other cybersecurity risks that bypass our security measures or disrupt our information technology systems or business. While we have security technologies, processes and procedures in place to protect against cybersecurity risks and security breaches, the hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design, manufacturer defects or other problems that could  unexpectedly  compromise  information  security.  In  addition,  because  the  techniques  used  to  obtain  unauthorized  access,  disable  or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them or implement adequate preventative measures.

As a result of any such incidents, we could be subject to litigation and regulatory risk, civil and criminal penalties, additional costs and diversion of management attention due to investigation, remediation efforts and engagement of third party consultants and legal counsel in connection with  such  incidents,  payment  of  'ransoms'  to  regain  access  to  our  systems  and  information,  loss  of  customers,  damage  to  customer relationships,  reduced  revenue and profits,  refunds  of  customer  charges  and  damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse  effect  on  our  business,  cash  flows,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  While  we  have  contingency  plans  and  insurance coverage for potential liabilities  of  this  nature,  they  may  not  be  sufficient  to  cover  all  claims  and  liabilities  and  in  some  cases  are  subject  to deductibles and layers of self-insured retention.

Cyber-attacks, unauthorized access to, or accidental disclosure of, consumer personally identifiable information including credit card information, that we collect through our websites may result in significant expense and adversely impact our reputation and business.

There is heightened concern and awareness over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy. While we have implemented security measures, our computer systems may nevertheless be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptions and security compromises. Any perceived or actual unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of personally identifiable information, whether through a compromise of our network by an unauthorized party, employee theft, misuse or error or otherwise,  could  harm  our  reputation,  impair  our  ability  to  attract  website  visitors,  or  subject  us  to  claims  or  litigation  arising  from  damages suffered by consumers, and adversely affect our operations, financial performance and condition.

We depend on cash generated from our operations to support our growth, and we may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

We primarily rely on cash flow generated from our sales to fund our current operations and growth initiatives. As we expand our business, we will need significant cash from operations to purchase inventory, increase product development, expand our manufacturer and supplier relationships, pay personnel, pay for the increased costs associated with operating as a public company and further invest in sales and marketing efforts. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund these activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available from our current or future credit facility, we may need additional equity or debt financing. If such financing is not available to us on satisfactory terms, our ability to operate and expand our business or to respond to competitive pressures could be harmed. Moreover, if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders may be diluted. The holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of our Common Stock. In addition, any indebtedness we incur may subject us to covenants that restrict our operations and will require interest and principal payments that could create additional cash demands and financial risk for us.

Our  indebtedness  may  limit  our  ability  to  invest  in  the  ongoing  needs  of  our  business  and  if  we  are  unable  to  comply  with  the covenants in our current credit agreements, our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.

On November 18, 2021, we entered into a credit facility with a syndicate of lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders, letter of credit issuer and swing line lender (the "Credit Agreement"). On December 31, 2022, $659.4 million in principal was outstanding under the credit facility. We are required to make quarterly payments of principal plus accrued interest. The Credit Agreement imposes various restrictions  and  contains  customary  affirmative  and  restrictive  covenants,  including,  without  limitation,  certain  reporting  obligations,  certain limitations on restricted payments, and limitations on liens, encumbrances and indebtedness. In addition, borrowings under the Credit Agreement are  jointly  and  severally  guaranteed  by  us  and  certain  of  our  wholly  owned  material  subsidiaries  and  our  future  subsidiaries  that  become guarantors (collectively the 'Loan Parties"). The First Lien Credit Agreement is secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the Loan Parties' assets, in each case subject to certain customary exceptions. If we fail to comply with the covenants or payments specified in the Credit Agreement, the lender could declare an event of default, which would give it the right to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable.


The Credit Agreement places certain conditions on us including, subject to certain conditions, reductions and exceptions, requiring us to utilize a portion  of  our  and  our  subsidiaries'  cash  flow  from  operations  to  make  payments  on  our  and  our  subsidiaries'  indebtedness,  reducing  the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development activity, return capital to our stockholders, and other general corporate purposes. Our and our subsidiaries' compliance with these conditions may limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to invest in ongoing business needs. For example, complying with these conditions:
- · increases vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;
- · limits flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in business or markets;
- · increases vulnerability to higher interest rates, as borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates;
- · limits our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital or other purposes; and
- · potentially places us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.


The Credit Agreement places certain limitations on our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to incur additional indebtedness. However, subject to the certain exceptions and baskets in the Credit Agreement, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness under and outside of such credit agreement. The Credit Agreement also limits or prohibits, among other things, and in each case, subject to exceptions, materiality thresholds and baskets, our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to: (a) pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase stock, or make other distributions; (b) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (c) sell stock in certain of our subsidiaries; (d) create or incur liens; (e) make acquisitions or investments; (f) transfer or sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies; (g) make certain payments or prepayments  of  indebtedness  subordinated  to  our  obligations  under  the  Credit Agreement;  and  (h)  enter  into  certain  transactions  with  our affiliates.

# Table of Contents

In  addition to the restrictions described above, the Credit Agreement requires us and certain of our subsidiaries to comply with certain other covenants, including a financial maintenance covenant regarding our total net leverage ratio on the last day of each fiscal quarter, with step downs to lower total net leverage ratio levels at specified times as set forth therein. Failure to comply with these covenants and certain other provisions of the Credit Agreement, or the occurrence of a change of control, could result in an event of default and an acceleration of the Loan Parties' obligations under the Credit Agreement or other indebtedness that we and our subsidiaries may incur in the future.

In February 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement which, among other things, increases the consolidated net leverage ratio financial covenant level applicable under the Credit Agreement as of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023 through the fiscal quarter  ending  March  31,  2024  (the  'Covenant  Relief  Period'),  to  initially  7.25:1.00,  and  provides  for  modified  step-down  levels  for  such covenant thereafter. As an ongoing condition to the Covenant Relief Period, the Company also agreed to (i) a minimum liquidity test, (ii) an interest coverage test, (iii) an anti-cash hoarding test at any time revolving loans are outstanding, and (iv) additional reporting obligations.

If such an event of default and acceleration of the Loan Parties' obligations occurs, subject to intercreditor agreements agreed to by the lenders, the lenders under the Credit Agreement would have the right to proceed against the collateral the Loan Parties granted to them to secure such indebtedness. If the debt under the Credit Agreement were to be accelerated, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell  sufficient  collateral  to  repay  this  debt,  which  would  immediately  and  materially  harm  our  and  our  subsidiaries'  business,  sales,  financial condition and results of operations. The threat of our debt being accelerated in connection with a change of control could make it more difficult for us to attract potential buyers or to consummate a change of control transaction that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.


## The announced upcoming discontinuance of publishing LIBOR rates may impact the cost or availability of financing for us.

A large portion of our variable rate indebtedness ($659 million of outstanding principal on December 31, 2022) references the London interbank offered rates ("LIBOR") as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is expected to be phased out by June 2023. With the expected discontinuation of LIBOR, the U.S. Federal Reserve has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate ('SOFR'), an index based on transactions in the Treasury repurchase market. SOFR is a relatively new reference rate and with a limited history, and changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates. At this time, it is uncertain whether SOFR or other alternative reference rates may become widely accepted alternatives for LIBOR. Although our LIBOR-based borrowings under our existing credit facility contemplate a transition from LIBOR to an alternative index, there is uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes relating to the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR. The transition may result in an adverse impact on our interest expense, in which event our available cash flow for general corporate requirements maybe adversely affected.


## Our failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could harm us.

As a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC's rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event that it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.

Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting, or any failure to fully remediate the existing or any future material weaknesses that may be found to exist, could inhibit our ability to accurately and on a timely basis report our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition in compliance with applicable securities laws. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Common Stock and Warrants could decline  and  we  could  be  subject  to  sanctions  or  investigations  by  NYSE,  the  SEC  or  other  regulatory authorities. Failure to remediate any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets and negatively impact the price and trading market for our Common Stock and Warrants.

## Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud.

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Our management expects that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and  instances  of  fraud,  if  any,  within  our  company  have  been  prevented  or  detected.  These  inherent  limitations  include  the  realities  that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

We  may  acquire  or  invest  in  other  companies,  which  we  may  not  be  able  to  integrate  successfully,  and  which  could  divert management s attention, result in dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our business, sales, ' financial condition and results of operations.

Our  growth  has  depended,  and  our  future  growth  is  likely  to  continue  to  depend,  in  part,  on  our  acquisition  strategy  and  the  successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. We intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets. In addition, we cannot assure that any acquisition, once successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to our results of operations or cash flow. Additionally, we may be unable to identify suitable businesses to acquire, which could negatively impact our growth, or we may be unable to complete proposed transactions in a timely matter if we fail to obtain any requisite regulatory approvals.

In  the  future,  we  may acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business, enhance our capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and  cause  us  to  incur  various  costs  and  expenses  in  identifying,  investigating,  and  pursuing  suitable  acquisitions,  whether  or  not  they  are consummated.


In any future acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired personnel, operations, and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. The success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties, including:
- · an ability to realize operating efficiencies, synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition, and possible delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products;
- · the risks associated with the assumption of product liabilities or contingent or undisclosed liabilities of the acquired company;
- · difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout acquired companies;
- · diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;
- · difficulties in retaining key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired business;
- · the ability to generate future cash flows or the availability of financing;
- · the incurrence of acquisition-related costs;
- · acquisition-related litigation;
- · unexpected capital expenditure requirements; or
- · the issuance of dilutive equity securities, the incurrence of debt, or the use of cash to fund such acquisitions.


In addition, an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisition-related debt, preacquisition potential tax liabilities, acquisition expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, or possible future impairment of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisitions. Even if an acquisition is integrated successfully, it may fail to realize expected revenues, gross and operating margins, net income and other returns.

We may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environment laws occurring prior to the date of acquisition, which may not be covered by environment insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers of the acquired businesses. We could also incur significant costs, including, but not limited to, remediation costs, natural resources damages, civil or criminal fines and sanctions, and third-party claims, as a result of past or future violations of, or liabilities, associated with environmental laws.


## Most members of our management team do not have prior experience in operating a public company.

Most members of our management team do not have prior experience in managing a publicly traded company. As such, the management team may encounter difficulties in successfully or effectively managing our transition to a public company and in complying with our reporting and other obligations under federal securities laws and other regulations and in connection with operating as a public company. Their lack of prior experience  in  dealing  with  the  reporting  and  other  obligations  and  laws  pertaining  to  public  companies  could  result  in  management  being required  to  devote  significant  time  to  these  activities  which  may  result  in  less  time  being  devoted  to  the  management  and  growth  of  the Company. In addition, we are hiring additional personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal controls over financial reporting required of public companies. We may incur significant expense in connection with these efforts.


## If our goodwill, other intangible assets, or fixed assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to earnings.

We may be required to record future impairments of goodwill, other intangible assets, or fixed assets to the extent the fair value of these assets falls  below  their  book  value.  Our  estimates  of  fair  value  are  based  on  assumptions  regarding  future  cash  flows,  gross  margins,  expenses, discount rates applied to these cash flows, and current market estimates of value. Estimates used for future sales growth rates, gross profit performance, and other assumptions used to estimate fair value could cause us to record material non-cash impairment charges, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.

During the third  quarter  of  2022,  we  concluded  it  was  necessary  to  reevaluate  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  for  impairment after supply chain challenges led to a downward revision of earnings estimates for 2022, which resulted in a decline in our market capitalization. Based on a quantitative assessment in the third quarter of 2022, we identified impairment of $2.4 million on certain indefinite-lived tradenames but  did  not  identify  any  indicators  of  goodwill  impairment.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022,  we  performed  our  annual  impairment  test  for goodwill, and a quantitative analysis did not identify any indicators of impairment. Based on the annual impairment assessment, the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by 15%. As of December 31, 2022, we concluded it was necessary to reevaluate goodwill for impairment due to a further downward revision of earnings estimates for 2022 and a continued decline in our market capitalization. Accordingly,  we  performed  a  qualitative  assessment  and  did  not  identify  any  indicators  of  impairment.  Goodwill  was  $418.1  million  as  of December 31, 2022, and is considered at higher risk of failing future quantitative impairment tests due to the narrow difference between fair value and carrying value.


## Global climate change and related regulations could negatively affect our business.

The effects of climate change, such as extreme weather conditions, create financial risks to our business. The demand for our products may be affected  by  extreme  weather  conditions,  such  as  droughts,  wildfires  and  flooding.  These  types  of  extreme  weather  events  have  and  may continue  to  adversely  impact  us,  our  suppliers,  our  customers  and  their  ability  to  purchase  our  products  and  our  ability  to  timely  receive appropriate raw materials to manufacture and transport our products on a timely basis. The effects of climate change could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain and disruptions that could result in increased prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them.

Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions, drought, or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. Certain impacts of physical risk may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at our facilities; extreme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain components; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; and heat and extreme weather events that cause long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of our customers' communities. Relative to transition risk, certain impacts may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; prolonged climate-related events  affecting  macroeconomic  conditions  with  related  effects  on  consumer  spending  and  confidence;  stakeholder  perception  of  our engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs.

Climate change is continuing to receive ever increasing attention worldwide, which could lead to additional legislative  and  regulatory  efforts to  increase  transparency  and  standardization  of  reporting  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  energy  policies,  and  renewable  energy  usage. Additionally,  new  federal  or  state  restrictions  on  emissions  of  carbon  dioxide  that  may  be  imposed  on  vehicles  and  automobile  fuels  could adversely affect demand for vehicles, annual miles driven or the products we sell or lead to changes in automotive technology. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require increased capital expenditures to improve our product portfolio to meet such new laws, regulations and standards.


## Increasing  scrutiny  and  evolving  expectations  with  respect  to  our  environmental,  social  and  governance  ( ESG )  practices  may ' ' impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.

In addition to the increased legislative and regulatory attention to climate change, customer, investor, and employee expectations in ESG have been rapidly evolving and increasing. While we have been committed to continuous improvements to our product portfolio to meet anticipated regulatory  standard  levels,  if  customers,  regulators  or  investors  demand  we  increase  our  greenhouse  gas  emission  or  renewable  energy disclosures  or  our  ESG  initiatives,  we  may  have  to  implement  additional  reporting  standards  and  reporting  requirements.  If  we  fail  to  meet customer, investor,  or  employee  expectations,  we  may  be  unable  to  attract  or  retain  our  consumer  base  or  talent.  Further,  there  can  be  no assurance that our commitments will be successful, that our products will be accepted by the market, that proposed regulation or deregulation will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will reflect our investments in new product development.

The standards by which ESG efforts and related matters are measured are developing and evolving, and we could be criticized for the scope of our initiatives and goals, or lack thereof. If we fail to comply with the evolving customer or investor or employee expectations and standards, or if we are perceived to have failed to adequately respond to such expectations and standards, we may suffer from reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial condition.


## Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks Related to Our Business


## We may become involved in legal or regulatory proceedings and audits.

Our  business  requires  compliance  with  many  laws  and  regulations,  including  labor  and  employment,  sales  and  other  taxes,  customs,  and consumer protection laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion, and sale of merchandise, and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and could also lead to damage awards, fines, and penalties. We may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, and other litigation. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings, audits, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions that could harm our operations or require  us  to  pay  substantial  amounts  of  money,  harming  our  business,  sales,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may be necessary, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention and resources, harming our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. Any pending or future legal or regulatory proceedings and audits could harm our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations.


## We may become subject to intellectual property claims or lawsuits that could cause us to incur significant costs or pay significant damages or that could prohibit us from selling our products.

Our  competitors  also  seek  to  obtain  patent,  trademark,  copyright  or  other  protection  of  their  proprietary  rights  and  designs  for  automotive products. From time to time, third parties have claimed or may claim in the future that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights. We evaluate any such claims and, where appropriate, have obtained or sought to obtain licenses or other business arrangements. To date, there have been no significant interruptions in our business as a result of any claims of infringement. However, in the future, intellectual property claims could force us to alter our existing products or withdraw them from the market or could delay the introduction of new products.

Various  patents  have  been  issued  to  our  competitors  in  the  automotive  parts  industry  and  these  competitors  may  assert  that  our  products infringe their patent or other proprietary rights. If our products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, we may be unable to obtain a license to use such technology, and we could incur substantial costs to redesign our products, withdraw them from the market, and/or to defend legal actions.

## Sales of our products by unauthorized retailers or distributors could adversely affect our authorized distribution channels and harm our reputation.

Some of our products may find their way to unauthorized outlets or distribution channels. This 'gray market' for our products can undermine authorized retailers and foreign wholesale distributors who promote and support our products and can injure our brands in the minds of our customers and consumers. On the other hand, stopping such commerce could result in a potential decrease in sales to those customers who are selling our products to unauthorized distributors or an increase in sales returns over historical levels. While we have taken some lawful steps to limit commerce of our products in the 'gray market' in both the United States and abroad, we have not stopped such commerce.


## We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which could subject us to liabilities, increase our costs or restrict our operations in the future.

Our properties and operations are subject to a number of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including, among others, regulations of the California Air Resources Board. These laws and regulations govern, among other things,  air  emissions,  water  discharges,  handling  and  disposal  of  solid  and  hazardous  substances  and  wastes,  soil  and  groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. Our failure to comply with such environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could result  in  substantial  civil  or  criminal  fines  or  penalties  or  enforcement  actions,  including  regulatory  or  judicial  orders  enjoining  or  curtailing operations or requiring remedial or corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other actions.

We may also be subject to liability for environmental investigations and cleanups, including at properties that we currently or previously owned or operated, even if such contamination was not caused by us, and we may face claims alleging harm to health or property or natural resource damages  arising  out  of  contamination  or  exposure  to  hazardous  substances.  We  may  also  be  subject  to  similar  liabilities  and  claims  in connection  with  locations  at  which  hazardous  substances  or  wastes  we  have  generated  have  been  stored,  treated,  otherwise  managed,  or disposed. Environmental conditions at or related to our current or former properties or operations, and/or the costs of complying with current or future environmental, health and safety requirements (which have become more stringent and complex over time) could materially adversely affect our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations.


## Changes in, or any failure to comply with, privacy laws, regulations, and standards may adversely affect our business.

Personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the United States, Europe, and in many other jurisdictions in which we operate.  The  regulatory  framework  for  privacy  and  security  issues  worldwide  is  rapidly  evolving  and  is  likely  to  remain  uncertain  for  the foreseeable future. Furthermore, federal, state, or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws and regulations affecting data privacy, all of which may be subject to invalidation by relevant foreign judicial bodies.

Industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in this area. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies and state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection agencies, including, but not limited to, the California Consumer Privacy Act ('CCPA'). Internationally, many jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply, including, but not limited to, the European General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'), which imposes certain privacy-related obligations and potential penalties and risks upon our business. In many jurisdictions,  enforcement  actions  and  consequences  for  noncompliance  are  also  rising.  In  addition  to  government  regulation,  privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. Any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, regulations, and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.


## Our insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims, and we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance.

We maintain insurance of the  type  and  in  amounts  that  we  believe  are  commercially  reasonable  and  that  is  available  to  businesses  in  our industry. We carry various types of insurance, including general liability, auto liability, workers' compensation, cyber, and excess umbrella, from highly rated insurance carriers. Market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we can obtain in the future or restrict our ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for  subsequent  insurance  coverage,  the  level  of  any  deductible  and/or  self-  insurance  retention  applicable  thereto,  the  level  of  aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks. In the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage that we carry may not be sufficient to compensate us for the losses we incur or any costs we are responsible for.

Changes in tax law or regulation, effective tax rates and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States (federal and state) and various foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective income tax rate could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations and application thereof. In particular, the U.S. government may enact significant changes to the taxation of business entities including, among others, an increase in the corporate income tax rate, the imposition of minimum taxes or surtaxes on certain types of income, significant changes to the taxation of income derived from international operations, and an addition of further limitations on the deductibility of business interest. For example, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act which,  among  other  things,  imposes  a  minimum  tax  on  certain  corporations  with  book  income  of  at  least  $1  billion,  subject  to  certain adjustments, and a 1% excise tax on certain stock buybacks and similar corporate actions. Any of these or similar developments or changes in federal, state, or international tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results.

We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income and other tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities globally. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and an adverse outcome of such a review or audit could  have  a  negative  effect  on  our  financial  position  and  operating  results.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  outcomes  from  such examinations, or changes in tax law or regulation impacting our effective tax rates, will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


## Risks Related to Ownership of Our Securities

Certain of our stockholders, including the Holley Stockholder and the Sponsor, may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders and may limit other stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters.

At  December  31,  2022,  the  'Holley  Stockholder'  and  the  "Sponsor"  (together  with  its  affiliates)  beneficially  own,  in  the  aggregate, approximately 55% of our shares of Common Stock, excluding any Warrants exercisable for Common Stock held by Sponsor or its affiliates (or 57% inclusive of shares of Common Stock underlying Warrants held by Sponsor and its affiliates). As a result of this concentration of stock ownership, these parties acting together have sufficient voting power to effectively control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including director elections and proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. On July 16, 2021, (the 'Closing' and such date, the 'Closing Date'), the Company, the Sponsor, certain affiliates of the Sponsor, the Holley Stockholder and Sentinel Capital Partners V, L.P., Sentinel Capital Partners V-A, L.P. and Sentinel Capital Investors V, L.P., controlling affiliates of the Holley Stockholder entered into the Stockholders' Agreement, pursuant to which the Holley Stockholder and the Sponsor have the right to designate nominees for election to our board of directors subject to certain beneficial ownership requirements.

In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a merger, consolidation or other business combination or change in control of our company and make some transactions that might otherwise give stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our securities more difficult or impossible without their support. Because we have opted out of Section 203 of the Delaware General  Corporation  Law  ('DGCL')  regulating  certain  business  combinations  with  interested  stockholders,  these  parties  may  transfer  their shares  of  Common  Stock  and  such  control  of  us  to  a  third  party,  which  would  not  require  the  approval  of  our  board  of  directors  or  other stockholders and may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. The interests of these parties may not always coincide with our interests as a company or the interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, these parties could cause us to enter  into  transactions  or  agreements  of  which  other  stockholders  may  not  approve  or  make  decisions  with  which  other  stockholders  would disagree. This concentration of ownership may also adversely affect the trading prices of our securities.

Each of the Holley Stockholder and the Sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold  interests  in  businesses  that  compete  directly  or  indirectly  with  us.  The  certificate  of  incorporation  provides  that  none  of  the  Holley Stockholder, the Sponsor, any of their affiliates or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities) or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. Each of the Holley Stockholder and  the  Sponsor  also  may  pursue  acquisition  opportunities  that  may  be  complementary  to  our  business  and,  as  a  result,  those  acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.

## Warrants are exercisable for Common Stock, which could increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.

On December 31, 2022, we had an aggregate of 14,633,311 Warrants issued and outstanding, representing the right to purchase an equivalent amount of shares of Common Stock. The Warrants became exercisable on October 9, 2021. The exercise price of the Warrants is $11.50 per share. To the extent such Warrants are exercised, additional shares of Common Stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to our stockholders and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market or the fact that such Warrants may be exercised could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. However, there is no guarantee that the Warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and as such, the Warrants may expire worthless.


## The Warrants may expire worthless, and the terms of the Warrants may be amended in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then-outstanding Warrants approve of such amendment.

The Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of the Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but it requires the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then-outstanding Warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of the Warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the Warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then-outstanding Warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the Warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding Warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments  to,  among  other  things,  increase  the  exercise  price  of  the  Warrants,  shorten  the  exercise  period  or  decrease  the  number  of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a Warrant.


## The market price and trading volume of Common Stock and Warrants may be volatile.


Stock markets, including the NYSE, have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. Even if an active, liquid and orderly trading market develops and is sustained for Common Stock and Warrants, the market price of Common Stock and Warrants may be volatile and could decline significantly, whether or not any price changes are related to matters specific to us. In addition, the trading volume in Common Stock and Warrants may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of Common Stock and Warrants declines significantly, stockholders may be unable to resell shares of Common Stock and Warrants at or above the market price of Common Stock and Warrants. We cannot guarantee that the market price of Common Stock and Warrants will not fluctuate widely or decline significantly in the future in response to a number of factors, including, among others, the following:
- · the realization of any of the risk factors presented in this Annual Report;
- · actual  or  anticipated  differences  in  our  estimates,  or  in  the  estimates  of  analysts,  for  our  revenues,  results  of  operations,  level  of indebtedness, liquidity or financial condition;
- · additions and departures of key personnel;
- · failure to comply with the requirements of the NYSE;
- · failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or other laws or regulations;
- · future issuances, sales or resales, or anticipated issuances, sales or resales, of Common Stock;
- · perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with Common Stock relative to other investment alternatives;
- · the performance and market valuations of other similar companies;
- · future announcements concerning our business or our competitors' businesses;
- · broad disruptions in the financial markets, including sudden disruptions in the credit markets;
- · speculation in the press or investment community;
- · actual, potential or perceived control, accounting or reporting problems;
- · changes in accounting principles, policies and guidelines; and
- · general economic and political conditions, such as inflation, labor shortages, disruption of the supply chain, interest rates, fuel prices and other transportation costs, international currency fluctuations, geopolitical instability and acts of war (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine) or terrorism.

In the past, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities.  This  type  of  litigation  could  result  in  substantial  costs  and  divert  our  management's  attention  and  resources,  which  could  have  a material adverse effect on us.


## Reports published by analysts, including projections in those reports that differ from our actual results, could adversely affect the market price and trading volume of Common Stock and Warrants.

The market for Common Stock and Warrants depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our  business.  Securities  research  analysts  may  establish  and  publish  their  own  periodic  projections  for  Holley.  These  projections  may  vary widely  and  may  not  accurately  predict  the  results  we  actually  achieve.  Our  share  price  may  decline  if  our  actual  results  do  not  match  the projections  of  these  securities  research  analysts.  Similarly,  if  one  or  more  of  the  analysts  who  write  reports  on  us  downgrades  our  stock  or publishes  inaccurate  or  unfavorable  research  about  our  business,  our  share  price  could  decline.  If  one  or  more  of  these  analysts  ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for Common Stock and Warrants could decrease, which might cause the market price and trading volume of our Common Stock and Warrants to decline significantly.


## Future sales of our Common Stock and Warrants in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.

On December 31, 2022, the Holley Stockholder and the Sponsor (together with its affiliates) beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 55% of our shares of Common Stock, excluding any warrants exercisable for Common Stock held by Sponsor or its affiliates (or 57% inclusive of shares of Common Stock underlying Warrants held by Sponsor and its affiliates). All shares held by our affiliates are eligible for resale in the public market, subject to applicable securities laws, including the Securities Act. Therefore, unless shares owned by any of our affiliates are registered  under  the  Securities  Act,  these  shares  may  only  be  resold  into  the  public  markets  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  an exemption from registration or safe harbor, including Rule 144 and the volume limitations, manner of sale requirements and notice requirements thereof. However, pursuant to the terms the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, of which the Company entered into with the Sponsor and the Holley Stockholder at the closing of the  Business  Combination,  the  Sponsor  and  the  Holley  Stockholder  have  the  right  to demand that we register their shares under the Securities Act as well as the right to include their shares in any registration statement that we file with the SEC, subject to certain exceptions. The registration statement, which was filed pursuant to these registration rights, and any registration of  other  shares  we  may  file  in  the  future,  enables  those  securities  to  be  sold  in  the  public  market. Any  sale  by  the  Holley  Stockholder,  the Sponsor or other affiliates and stockholders, or any perception in the public markets that such a transaction may occur could cause the market price of our Common Stock and Warrants to decline materially.


## We may redeem unexpired Warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to the Warrant holders, thereby making the Warrants worthless.

We have the ability to redeem outstanding Warrants at any time prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per Warrant, provided that the last reported  sales  price  of  Common  Stock  equals  or  exceeds  $18.00  per  share  (as  adjusted  for  stock  splits,  stock  dividends,  reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) on the trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the Warrant holders. If and when the Warrants become redeemable by us, we may not exercise our redemption right if the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or we are unable to effect such registration or qualification. We will use our best efforts to register or qualify such shares of Common Stock under the blue-sky laws of the state of residence in those states in which the Warrants were offered. Redemption of the outstanding Warrants could force stockholders (i) to exercise the Warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so, (ii) to sell the Warrants at the then-current market price when stockholders might otherwise wish to hold the Warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding Warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of the Warrants. None of the Private Warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the Sponsor, or its permitted transferees.

The NYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit stockholders  ability to make transactions in our ' securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.

Our Common Stock and Warrants are currently listed on NYSE. We cannot assure that our securities will continue to be listed on the NYSE. In order  to  continue  listing  our  securities  on  the  NYSE,  we  will  be  required  to  maintain  certain  financial,  distribution  and  stock  price  levels. Generally, we will be required to maintain a minimum amount in stockholders' equity.


If the NYSE delists our securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the exchange's continued listing standards or otherwise, and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market, but no assurance of this can be given. If this were to occur, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:
- · a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;
- · reduced liquidity for our securities;
- · a determination that our Common Stock is a 'penny stock' which will require brokers trading in our Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;
- · a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and
- · a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.


The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain  securities,  which  are  referred  to  as  'covered  securities.'  Since  our  Common  Stock  and  Warrants  are  listed  on  the  NYSE,  they  are covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. Further, if we were no longer listed on the NYSE, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.


## Future issuances of debt securities and equity securities may adversely affect us, including the market price of Common Stock and may be dilutive to existing stockholders.

There is no assurance that we will not incur debt or issue equity ranking senior to Common Stock. Those securities will generally have priority upon liquidation.  Such  securities  also  may  be  governed  by  an  indenture  or  other  instrument  containing  covenants  restricting  their  operating flexibility.  Additionally,  any  convertible  or  exchangeable  securities  that  the  Company  issues  in  the  future  may  have  rights,  preferences  and privileges  more  favorable  than  those  of  Common  Stock.  Separately,  additional  financing  may  not  be  available  on  favorable  terms,  or  at  all. Because our decision to issue debt or equity in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital raising efforts. As a result, future capital raising efforts may reduce the market price of Common Stock and be dilutive to existing stockholders.


## We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.

We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the further development and expansion of our business and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend  on  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  capital  requirements,  restrictions  contained  in  future  agreements  and  financing instruments, business prospects and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.

The  JOBS  Act  permits ' emerging  growth  companies   like  us  to  take  advantage  of  certain  exemptions  from  various  reporting ' requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

We qualify as an 'emerging growth company' as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we take advantage  of  certain  exemptions  from  various  reporting  requirements  applicable  to  other  public  companies  that  are  not  emerging  growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, sayon-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of the Common Stock and Warrants that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private  companies.  The  JOBS  Act  provides  that  a  company  can  elect  to  opt  out  of  the  extended  transition  period  and  comply  with  the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected to avail ourselves of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised  standard.  This  may  make  comparison  of  our  financial  statements  with  another  public  company  that  is  neither  an  emerging  growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

We cannot predict if  investors  will  find  our  Common  Stock  and  Warrants  less  attractive  because  we  will  rely  on  these  exemptions.  If  some investors find our Common Stock and Warrants less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock, and Warrants and more stock price volatility.

Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions, including anti- takeover provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.


The  certificate  of  incorporation,  bylaws  and  the  DGCL  contain  provisions  that  could  have  the  effect  of  rendering  more  difficult,  delaying,  or preventing  an  acquisition  that  stockholders  may  consider  favorable,  including  transactions  in  which  stockholders  might  otherwise  receive  a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock, and therefore depress the trading price of Common Stock. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. Among other things, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions regarding:
- · a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;
- · prevent stockholders from acting by written consent;
- · limit the ability of stockholders to amend our certificate of incorporation;
- · limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors;
- · prevent stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;
- · the ability of the board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock, including 'blank check' preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder;
- · the certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors;
- · the limitation of the liability of, and the indemnification of, our directors and officers;
- · the ability of the board of directors to amend the bylaws; and
- · advance  notice  procedures  with  which  stockholders  must  comply  to  nominate  candidates  to  the  board  of  directors  or  to  propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting.

These provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control, including transactions in which the acquirer may offer a premium price for our Common Stock and Warrants, or changes in our board of directors or management.

In addition, our Incentive Plan provides for accelerated vesting of awards that are assumed or substituted in connection with a change in control of the Company as a result of the change in control if a participant experiences a qualifying termination within two years following the change in control, which could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.

The provisions of the certificate  of  incorporation  requiring  exclusive  forum  in  the  Court  of  Chancery  of  the  State  of  Delaware  for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.

The certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we select or consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law: (a) the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting any internal corporate claims, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have, or declines to accept, jurisdiction, another state court or a federal court located within the State of Delaware); and (b) the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall be the federal district courts of the United States of America. For purposes of the foregoing, 'internal corporate claims' means claims, including claims in the right of the Company that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, employee or stockholder  in  such  capacity,  or  as  to  which  the  DGCL  confers  jurisdiction  upon  the  Court  of  Chancery. Any  person  or  entity  purchasing  or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of Common Stock will be deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the certificate of incorporation's exclusive forum provision (an 'FSC Enforcement Action'), and (ii) having service of process made upon such holder of Common Stock in any such FSC Enforcement Action by service upon such holder of Common Stock's counsel in such action as agent for such holder of Common Stock.

These provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies' certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.

## Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations '

Unless  the  context  requires  otherwise,  references  to ' Holley, ' ' we, ' ' us, ' ' our   and ' ' the  Company   in  this  section  are  to  the  business  and ' operations of Holley Inc. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Holley s consolidated financial statements and ' related notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause Holley s actual results to differ materially from management s ' ' expectations.  Factors  that  could  cause  such  differences  are  discussed  herein  and  under  the  caption, ' Cautionary  Note  Regarding  ForwardLooking Statements. '


## Overview

We are a designer, marketer, and manufacturer of high-performance automotive aftermarket products serving car and truck enthusiasts, with sales,  processing,  and  distribution  facilities  reaching  most  major  markets  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  Europe  and  China.  Holley  designs, markets, manufactures and distributes a diversified line of performance automotive products including fuel injection systems, tuners, exhaust products, carburetors, safety equipment and various other performance automotive products. Our products are designed to enhance street, offroad, recreational and competitive vehicle performance and safety.

Innovation is at the core of our business and growth strategy with approximately 34% of our 2022 sales coming from products introduced by us into the market since 2017. We have a history of developing innovative products, including new products in existing product families, product line expansions, and accessories, as well as products that bring us into new categories. We have thoughtfully expanded our product portfolio over time to adapt to consumer needs.

In  addition, we have historically used strategic acquisitions to (i) expand our brand portfolio, (ii) enter new product categories and consumer segments, (iii) increase DTC scale and connection, (iv) expand share in current product categories and (v) realize value-enhancing revenue and cost synergies. While we believe our business is positioned for continued organic growth, we intend to continue evaluating opportunities for strategic acquisitions that would complement our current business and expand our addressable target market.


## Factors Affecting our Performance

We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in the section of this Form 10-K titled 'Risk Factors.'


## Business Combination

On July 16, 2021, we consummated a business combination ('Business Combination') pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 11, 2021, (the 'Merger Agreement'), by and among Empower Ltd., ('Empower'), Empower Merger Sub I Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Empower ('Merger Sub I'), Empower Merger Sub II LLC, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Empower ('Merger Sub II'), and Holley Intermediate Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings").

The  Merger Agreement  provided  for,  among  other  things,  the  following  transactions:  (i)  Merger  Sub  I  merged  with  and  into  Holdings,  the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub I ceased and Holdings became the surviving corporation, and (ii) Holdings merged with and into Merger Sub II, the separate corporate existence of Holdings ceased, and Merger Sub II became the surviving limited liability company. Upon closing,  Empower changed its name to Holley Inc. and its trading  symbol  on  the  New York  Stock  Exchange  (the  'NYSE')  from  'EMPW'  to 'HLLY.'

The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Holdings was deemed the accounting acquirer with Holley Inc. as the successor registrant. As such, Empower was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes, and financial statements for periods prior to the Business Combination are those of Holdings.

As  a  result  of  the  Business  Combination,  Holley  Inc.  listed  on  the  NYSE,  which  required  us  to  hire  additional  personnel  and  implement procedures  and  processes  to  address  public  company  regulatory  requirements  and  customary  practices.  We  have  incurred  and  expect  to continue to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors' and officers' liability insurance, director fees, and additional internal and external accounting, legal, and administrative resources, including increased personnel costs, audit and other professional service fees.

## Acquisitions

Holley has historically pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. The Company has pursued acquisitions that it believes will help drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value. Holley targets companies that are market leaders, expand the Company's geographic  presence,  provide  a  highly  synergistic  opportunity  and/or  enhance  Holley's  ability  to  provide  a  wide  array  of  its  products  to  its customers through its distribution network.


From  2020  through  2022,  Holley  completed  15  acquisitions.  The  most  significant  of  these  acquisitions  impacting  the  comparability  of  our operating results were:
- · Baer, Inc. : On December 23, 2021, Holley acquired Baer, Inc. doing business as Baer Brakes, a developer and supplier of brakes and brake systems. This acquisition moves Holley closer to its goals of providing complete vehicle solutions by adding a new product category and brake system expertise.
- · Brothers Mail Order Industries, Inc. : On December 16, 2021, Holley acquired Brothers Mail Order Industries, Inc., doing business as Brothers Trucks, a distributor of Classic and Custom vehicle restoration parts serving the Chevrolet and GMC truck aftermarket. This acquisition increases Holley's offering in truck and SUV appearance items.
- · Advance Engine Management Inc. : On April 14, 2021, Holley acquired Advance Engine Management Inc., doing business as AEM Performance  Electronics,  a  developer  and  supplier  of  electronic  control  and  monitoring  systems  for  performance  automotive applications. This acquisition increases Holley's penetration into the import and other sport compact cars submarket.
- · Simpson  Performance  Products: On  November  16,  2020,  Holley  acquired  Simpson  Performance  Products,  Inc.  ('Simpson'),  a designer  and  seller  of  motorsport  safety  products  including  helmets  head  &  neck  restraints,  seat  belts,  fire  suits  and  more.  This acquisition extended Holley's footprint into the safety and racing segment.
- · Drake Automotive Group: On November 11, 2020, Holley acquired Drake Automotive Group LLC ('Drake'), a designer and seller of automotive  aftermarket  appearance  parts,  wheels,  chassis  &  suspension  products  and  accessories.  This  acquisition  increases Holley's penetration within the Ford/Mustang platform where it has historically been under indexed relative to the market.


The  acquisitions  have  all  been  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  Accounting  Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 805, Business Combinations , and the operations of the acquired entities are included in our historical results for the periods following the closing of the acquisition. See Note 1, ' Description of the Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ,'  and  Note  2,  ' Business Combination and Acquisitions ,'  in  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company's acquisitions and investments.


## Business Environment

COVID-19 has adversely impacted global supply chain and general economic conditions. The Company has continued to experience disruptions and higher costs in manufacturing, supply chain, logistical operations, and shortages of certain Company products in distribution channels. The full  extent  of  COVID-19's  effect  on  the  Company's  operational  and  financial  performance  in  the  future  will  depend  on  future  developments, including but not limited to the duration, spread, intensity and phase of the pandemic in various countries; the emergence of COVID-19 variants and the utilization and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines against these variants; the further impact of COVID-19 on the global economy; and demand for the Company's products and services. Should the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic not improve, or worsen, or if the Company's attempt to mitigate its impact on its supply chain, operations and costs is not successful, the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. See Part I: Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion on the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on our business.

The  Company's  business  and  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  liquidity  are  impacted  by  broad  economic  conditions  including inflation, labor shortages, and disruption of the supply chain, as well as by geopolitical events, specifically the conflict in Ukraine. The Company's operations have been adversely impacted by inflationary pressures primarily related to transportation, labor and component costs. Sales growth in certain products has been constrained by continuing supply chain challenges and automotive electronic component shortages. In response to the global supply chain volatility and inflationary impacts, the Company has attempted to minimize potential adverse impacts on its business with cost savings initiatives, price increases to customers, and by increasing inventory levels of certain products and working closely with its suppliers and  customers  to  minimize  disruptions  in  delivering  products  to  customers.  The  Company's  profitability  has  been,  and  may  continue  to  be, adversely affected by constrained consumer demand, a shift in sales to lower-margin products, and demands on our performance that increased our  costs.  Should  the  ongoing  macroeconomic conditions not improve, or worsen, or if the Company's attempt to mitigate the impact on its supply chain, operations and costs is not successful, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

## Key Components of Results of Operations


## Net Sales

The principal activity from which the Company generates its sales is the designing, marketing, manufacturing and distribution of performance aftermarket automotive parts for its end consumers. Sales are displayed net of rebates and sales returns allowances. Sales returns are recorded as a charge against gross sales in the period in which the related sales are recognized.


## Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost of purchased parts and manufactured products, including materials and direct labor costs. In addition, warranty, incoming shipping and handling and inspection and repair costs are also included within costs of goods sold. Reductions in the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are also a component of cost of goods sold.


## Selling, General, and Administrative

Selling,  general,  and  administrative  consist  of  payroll  and  related  personnel  expenses,  IT  and  office  services,  office  rent  expense  and professional services. In addition, self-insurance, advertising, research and development, outgoing shipping costs, pre-production and start-up costs are also included within selling, general, and administrative. The Company has incurred additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses necessary to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange and related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as higher expenses for general and director and officer insurance, investor relations and other professional services.


## Acquisition and Restructuring Costs

Acquisition and restructuring costs consist of professional fees for legal, accounting, consulting, administrative, and other professional services directly attributable to potential acquisitions. In addition, operational restructuring costs are included within this classification.


## Related Party Acquisition and Management Fee Costs

Related  party  acquisition  and  management  fee  costs  consist  of  fees  paid  to  the  Company's  historical  private  equity  sponsor  pursuant  to  a management  services  agreement  for  management  services  and  consulting  services  directly  attributable  to  potential  acquisitions.  Upon  the Closing of the Business Combination, the management services agreement with our private equity sponsor was terminated.


## Interest Expense

Interest expense consists of interest due on the indebtedness under our credit facilities. On December 31, 2022, $659.4 million was outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Interest is based on LIBOR or the prime rate, plus the applicable margin rate.

## Net Sales

Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, decreased $4.4 million, or 0.6%, to $688.4 million compared to $692.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Non-comparable sales associated with acquisitions contributed $31.3 million to net sales in 2022, or year-over-year growth of 4.5%. The remaining comparable sales decreased by $35.7 million, or 5.2%. The decline in comparable sales was primarily driven by supply chain constraints that prevented the Company from building and shipping to orders received from customers and stabilizing demand due to a reduction in disposable income of our consumers. As a result, lower unit volume drove a decrease of approximately $88.5 million that was partially offset by improved price realization of approximately $52.8 million compared to 2021. Comparable year-over-year results by category include a decrease in electronic system sales of $28.1 million (9.1% category decline), a decrease in exhaust system sales of $11.4 million (14.6% category decline), a decrease in mechanical system sales of $4.6 million (3.0% category decline), a decrease in safety product sales of $3.2 million (4.9% category decline), and accessories sales growth of $11.6 million (13.6% category growth).


## Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold for year ended December 31, 2022, increased $28.7 million, or 7.1%, to $434.8 million compared to $406.0 million for the year  ended  December  31,  2021.  The  increase  in  cost  of  goods  sold  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  in  which  sales  declined reflects compression in gross profit margin due to manufacturing inefficiencies driven by supply chain constraints, higher product rationalization charges, higher warranty costs, and inflationary pressures on certain other costs.

## Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2022, decreased $33.2 million, or 11.6%, to $253.7 million compared to $286.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2022, of 36.8% decreased from gross margin of 41.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin was driven primarily by inflationary factors, higher expenses associated with product rationalization and warranty costs, and a shift in the mix of products sold towards products with lower margins due in part to limitations caused by supply chain challenges. In general, gross margin and margins on individual products will remain under pressure due to various factors, including potential increases in manufacturing costs and the shift of the Company's sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. Future gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products.


## Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased $33.9 million, or 29.1%, to $150.7 million compared to $116.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. When expressed as a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative costs increased to 21.9% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 16.9% of sales in 2021. The increase in costs was driven by a $19.4 million increase in compensation expense related to equity awards, which included an $11.4 million cumulative adjustment related to the early vesting of profit interest units granted by the Holley Stockholder prior to the Business Combination. Outbound shipping and handling costs increased $7.6 million, reflecting inflationary pressures on domestic shipping companies, and recent acquisitions contributed $3.7 million to the increase in selling, general and administrative costs.


## Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased $0.8 million, or 2.8%, to $29.1 million compared to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in research and development costs reflects our pursuit of product innovation and new products.


## Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets

Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased $0.7 million, or 4.9%, to $14.7 million compared to $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to recent acquisitions. Additionally, an impairment charge of $2.4 million was recognized on certain indefinite-lived tradenames during 2022 (see Note 5, ' Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ' in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company's recognition of impairment charges).


## Acquisition and Restructuring Costs

Acquisition  and  restructuring  costs  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  decreased  $19.2  million  to  $4.5  million,  as  compared  to  $23.7 million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021. The  year  ended December 31, 2021, included an adjustment of $17.2 million for contingent consideration payable for the acquisition of Simpson Performance Products ('Simpson').


## Related Party Acquisition and Management Fee Costs

Upon the Closing of the Business Combination, the management services agreement with our private equity sponsor was terminated. Related party acquisition and management fee costs for the year ended December 31, 2021, were $25.8 million, of which $23.3 million represents a fee paid upon the Closing of the Business Combination.


## Operating Income

As a result of factors described above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022, decreased $26.8 million, or 34.5%, to $50.7 million compared to $77.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.


## Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain of $57.0 million from the change in fair value of the warrant liability as compared to a loss of $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The warrant liability reflects the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the Business Combination.

# Change in Fair Value of Earn-Out Liability

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain of $10.7 million from the change in fair value of the earn-out liability as compared to a loss of $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The earn-out liability reflects the fair value of the earn-out shares resulting from the Business Combination.


## Interest Expense

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased $1.1 million, or 2.8%, to $40.2 million compared to $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to a higher effective interest rate.


## Income (Loss) before Income Taxes

As a result of factors described above, we recognized net income of $78.3 million before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net loss before income taxes of $(16.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2021.


## Income Tax Expense

We recognized  income  tax  expense  of  $4.5  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  compared  to  $10.4  million  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2021. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 5.7%. The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate in 2022 was primarily due to permanent differences resulting from the change in fair value of the warrant and earn-out liabilities. The difference between the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the federal statutory rate in 2021 was due to the permanent difference resulting from the adjustment to the Simpson earn-out liability during the period and the change in fair value of the warrant and earn-out liabilities.


## Net Income (Loss) and Total Comprehensive Income (Loss)

As a result of factors described above, we recognized net income of $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net loss of $(27.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, we recognized total comprehensive income of $73.1 million for the year  ended  December  31,  2022,  compared  to  total  comprehensive  loss  of  $(26.7)  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021. Comprehensive income (loss) includes the effect of foreign currency translation and pension liability adjustments.

## Net Sales

Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased $188.6 million, or 37.4%, to $692.8 million compared to $504.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Non-comparable sales associated with acquisitions contributed $116.4 million or 23.1% of year-over-year growth. The remainder of the increase was driven by a $37.3 million, or 25.1%, increase in electronic systems products sold and an $18.4 million, or 18.1%, increase in mechanical systems products sold.


## Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold for year ended December 31, 2021, increased $110.1 million, or 37.2%, to $406.0 million compared to $295.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

When expressed as a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative costs increased to 16.9% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 14.1% of sales in 2020. Recent acquisitions accounted for $18.5 million of the increase in selling, general and administrative costs. The increase in costs was also driven by a $4.5 million increase in compensation expense related to equity awards, a $5.4 million increase in outbound shipping costs related to higher sales and domestic supply chain pressure, and a $5.9 million increase in professional fees, primarily due to the Business Combination and as a result of becoming a public company.

## Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability

For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a loss of $32.6 million from the change in fair value of the warrant liability. The warrant liability reflects the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the Business Combination.


## Change in Fair Value of Earn-Out Liability

For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a loss of $8.9 million from the change in fair value of the earn-out liability. The earn-out liability reflects the fair value of the earn-out shares resulting from the Business Combination.


## Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt

For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  we  recognized  a  $13.6  million  loss  on  the  early  extinguishment  of  debt.  The  extinguishment  loss includes a write off of $12.2 million in unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our previous first lien and second lien notes due to the refinancing of our previous credit facility (refer to Note 6, ' Debt ' for further discussion). Additionally, we wrote off $1.4 million of unamortized debt issuance costs when $100 million of the net proceeds from the Business Combination were used to reduce the outstanding principal balance of our second lien note.


## Interest Expense

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, decreased $4.7 million, or 10.6%, to $39.1 million compared to $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to a lower effective interest rate combine with the favorable impact of the $100 million paydown on our second lien note in July 2021.


## Income (Loss) before Income Taxes

As a result of factors described above, we recognized a loss of $(16.7) million before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to income before income taxes of $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.


## Income Tax Expense

We recognized tax expense on a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to permanent differences resulting from the Business Combination, change in fair value of the warrant and earn-out liabilities, and the adjustment to the Simpson earnout during the period.


## Net Income (Loss) and Total Comprehensive Income (Loss)

As a result of factors described above, we recognized a net loss of $(27.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net income of $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, we recognized total comprehensive loss of $(26.7) million for the year  ended  December  31,  2021,  compared  to  total  comprehensive  income  of  $32.6  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020. Comprehensive income (loss) includes the effect of foreign currency translation and pension liability adjustments.

# Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Holley believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance. In addition, Holley uses these measures internally to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor its business. Holley believes that these non-GAAP financial measures help to depict a more realistic representation of the performance of the underlying business, enabling the Company to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future. Holley believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that its management uses in analyzing operating results.

Holley  defines  EBITDA  as  earnings  before  (a)  depreciation,  (b)  amortization  of  intangible  assets,  (c)  interest  expense,  and  (d)  income  tax expense.  Holley  defines  Adjusted  EBITDA  as  EBITDA  plus  (i)  acquisition  and  restructuring  costs,  which  for  2021  includes  a  $17.2  million adjustment  due  to  a  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  Simpson  acquisition  contingent  consideration  payable,  (ii)  impairment  of  indefinite-lived intangible assets, (iii) changes in the fair value of the warrant liability, (iv) changes in the fair value of the earn-out liability, (v) compensation expense related to equity awards, (vi) product rationalization initiatives aimed at eliminating unprofitable or slow-moving stock keeping units, (vii) loss on the early extinguishment of debt (viii) related party acquisition and management fee costs, (ix) notable items that consist primarily of noncash adjustments related to the adoption of ASC Topic 842, " Leases," in 2022, amortization of the fair market value increase in inventory due to acquisitions in 2021, and the amortization of the fair market value increase in inventory due to acquisitions and a legal settlement in 2020, and (x) other expenses, which for 2022 includes a $1.0 million loss on the sale of a business (see Note 2, " Business Combination, Acquisitions, and Divestiture ,"  in  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  additional information related to the divestiture) and for all periods includes net losses from disposal of fixed assets and foreign currency transactions. We have  included  within  the  definition  of Adjusted  EBITDA  impairment  of  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  warrant liabilities,  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  earn-out  liability,  and  losses  from  the  early  extinguishment  of  debt,  as  management  believes  such matters, when they occur, do not directly reflect the performance of the underlying business.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP') and may be different  from  non-GAAP financial  measures  used  by  other  companies. These  measures  should  not  be  considered  as  measures  of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from or included in these metrics are significant components in understanding and assessing Holley's financial performance. These metrics should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.

The following unaudited table presents the reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):

# Liquidity and Capital Resources

Holley's  primary  cash  needs  are  to  support  working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  acquisitions,  and  debt  repayments.  The  Company  has generally financed its historical needs with operating cash flows, capital contributions and borrowings under its credit facilities. These sources of liquidity  may  be  impacted  by  various  factors,  including  demand  for  Holley's  products,  investments  made  in  acquired  businesses,  plant  and equipment and other capital expenditures, and expenditures on general infrastructure and information technology.

On December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $26.2 million and availability of $113.8 million under its revolving credit facility. The Company has a senior secured revolving credit facility with $125 million in borrowing capacity. On December 31, 2022, the Company had $10.0 million in borrowings and $1.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In February 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement which, among other things, contains a minimum liquidity financial covenant of $45 million, which includes unrestricted cash and any available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. The amendment also increases the consolidated net leverage ratio financial covenant level applicable under the Credit Agreement as of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023 through the fiscal quarter  ending  March  31,  2024  (the  'Covenant  Relief  Period'),  to  initially  7.25:1.00,  and  provides  for  modified  step-down  levels  for  such covenant thereafter.

The  Company  is  obligated  under  various  operating  leases  for  facilities,  equipment,  and  automobiles  with  estimated  lease  payments  of approximately  $7.2  million,  including  short-term  leases,  due  in  fiscal  year  2023.  See  Note  14,  " Lease  Commitments" in  the  Notes  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company's lease obligations.

Holley's  capital  expenditures  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022  of  $13.6  million  are  primarily  related  to  ongoing  maintenance  and improvements,  including  investments  related  to  upgrading  and  maintaining  our  information  technology  systems,  tooling  for  new  products, vehicles for product development, and machinery and equipment for operations. We expect capital expenditures in the range of $10 million to $15 million in fiscal year 2023 .

See Note 6, " Debt " in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail of our credit facility and the timing of principal maturities. On December 31, 2022, based on the then current weighted average interest rate of 8.4%, expected interest payments associated with outstanding debt totaled approximately $55.7 million for fiscal year 2023.

As discussed under 'Business Environment' above, although the future impact of supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are highly uncertain,  the  Company  believes  that  its  current  operating  performance,  operating  plan,  cash  position,  and  borrowings  available  under  its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy its liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

Operating Activities . Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $12.3 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash provided by prepaids and other current assets, accrued interest  and  accounts  receivable  increased  by  $14.6  million,  $5.9  million,  and  $3.3  million,  respectively.  Offsetting  these  increases  were decreases in cash provided by inventory, accrued liabilities and accounts payable of $13.3 million, $13.0 million, and $9.5 million, respectively. The changes in accounts receivable,  accounts  payable,  and  inventory  are  impacted  by  fluctuations  in  sales  and  accrued  interest,  accounts receivable and accounts payable are impacted by the timing of receipts and payments.

Cash  provided  by  operating  activities  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  was  $21.6  million  compared  to  cash  provided  by  operating activities of $88.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash provided by accounts receivable, accrued liabilities and accounts payable increased by $11.8 million, $9.2 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. Offsetting these increases were decreases in cash provided by inventory and prepaids and other current assets of $67.1 million and $15.3 million, respectively. The changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory reflect the growth in the business in 2021.

Investing Activities . Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $25.0 million, primarily relating to acquisitions of $14.3 million and capital expenditures of $13.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities was $134.1 million, primarily relating to acquisitions of $119.2 million and capital expenditures of $15.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $165.6 million, primarily relating to acquisitions of $156.8 million and capital expenditures of $9.4 million.

Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $2.9 million, which primarily reflected net borrowings on long-term debt. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $77.2 million, which included $630.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt, $132.3 million in cash received due to the recapitalization, and $25.0 million in net borrowings under the revolving credit agreement, largely offset by $687.5 million in principal payments on long-term debt, $13.4 million in deferred financing fees, and $9.2 million in payment of contingent consideration on acquisitions. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $140.5 million, which included $170.0 million of proceeds from long-term debt, net of $24.6 million in debt payments and $4.7 million in deferred financing fees.

Working Capital . On December 31, 2022, working capital was $223.7 million compared to $199.9 million on December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, inventories increased by $48.5 million. Offsetting this increase in working capital were a decrease in cash of $10.2 million, an increase in accrued liabilities of $8.5 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $4.3 million,

Holley's  working  capital  on  December  31,  2021,  increased  $23.9  million  from  $176.0  million  at  December  31,  2020.  For  the  year  ended December  31,  2021,  inventories  increased  by  $51.1  million,  prepaid  and  other  current  assets  increased  by  $13.9  million,  while  acquisition contingent consideration payable decreased by $9.2 million. Offsetting these items were a decrease in Holley's cash balance of $35.3 million and an increase in accounts payable of $11.1 million.


## Critical Accounting Estimates

The discussion and analysis of Holley's financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. See Note 1, " Description of the Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting  Policies" ,  in  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  a complete  summary  of  the  significant  accounting  policies  used  in  the  presentation  of  Holley's  financial  statements.  The  preparation  of  these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Holley evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The estimates and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may  differ  from  these  estimates  under  different  assumptions  or  conditions,  impacting  Holley's  reported  results  of  operations  and  financial condition.

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that management considers the most important to the portrayal of Holley's financial condition and  results  of  operations  because  they  require  the  most  difficult,  subjective,  or  complex  judgments,  often  as  a  result  of  the  need  to  make estimates  about  the  effect  of  matters  that  are  inherently  uncertain.  Holley  believes  that  its  most  critical  accounting  estimates  are  related  to accounting for inventory reserves, the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in the Business Combination and acquisitions, and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets. These critical accounting policies are addressed below.

## Inventory Reserve

The Company's inventories are stated at the lower of  cost  or  net  realizable  value  using  the  first-in,  first-out  (FIFO)  method. Adjustments  to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances. See Part IV, Item 15 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company's inventory valuation reserve.

We regularly  monitor  inventory  quantities  on  hand  and  on  order  and  record  write-downs  for  excess  and  obsolete  inventories  based  on  our estimate of the demand for our products, potential obsolescence of technology, product life cycles, and when pricing trends or forecast indicate that  the  carrying  value  of  inventory  exceeds  our  estimated  selling  price.  These  factors  are  affected  by  market  and  economic  conditions, technology changes, and new product introductions and require estimates that may include elements that are uncertain. Actual demand may differ  from  forecasted  demand  and  may  have  a  material  effect  on  our  gross  margin.  If  inventory  is  written  down,  a  new  cost  basis  will  be established that cannot be increased in future periods.


## Fair Value of Acquired Assets and Liabilities

Assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values and the values of assets in use, and often requires the application of significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions. The same applies to assigning fair market values to the liabilities assumed in the Business Combination at the date of the transaction and at each reporting date thereafter. While the ultimate responsibility resides with management, for certain acquisitions the Company retains the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including intangible assets,  tangible  long-  lived  assets,  and  liabilities  assumed  in  the  Business  Combination. Acquired  intangible  assets,  excluding  goodwill,  are valued using various methodologies including discounted cash flows, relief from royalty, and multiperiod excess earnings depending on the type of intangible asset purchased. These methodologies incorporate various estimates and assumptions, such as projected revenue growth rates, profit margins and forecasted cash flows based on discount rates and terminal growth rates. The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of its private warrants and earn-out liability assumed in the Business Combination, which requires certain subjective inputs  and  assumptions,  including  expected  common  stock  price  volatility,  expected  term,  and  risk-free  interest  rates.  These  estimates  and assumptions could vary significantly, which could result in material differences in the fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities. See Note 2,  " Business Combination, Acquisitions, and Divestiture "  and  Note  8,  " Fair  Value  Measurements "  in  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value.


## Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually or more often if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the third quarter of 2022, management concluded it was necessary to reevaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment after supply chain challenges led to management revising its earnings estimate for 2022, which resulted in a  decline  in  the  Company's  market  capitalization.  Based  on  a  quantitative  assessment  in  the  third  quarter  of  2022,  we  did  not  identify  any indicators  of  goodwill  impairment.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022,  management  performed  the  annual  impairment  test  for  goodwill,  and a  quantitative  analysis  did  not  identify  any  indicators  of  impairment.  Based  on  the  annual  impairment  assessment,  the  estimated  fair  value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by 15%. As of December 31, 2022, management concluded it was necessary to reevaluate goodwill for impairment due to a further downward revision of its earnings estimate for 2022 and a continued decline in the Company's market capitalization. Accordingly,  management performed a qualitative assessment and did not identify any indicators of impairment. Goodwill was $418.1  million  as  of  December  31,  2022,  and  is  considered  at  higher  risk  of  failing  future  quantitative  impairment  tests  due  to  the  narrow difference between fair value and carrying value. No goodwill impairment changes were incurred during 2022 and 2021.

Intangible assets include trade names, customer relationships and developed technology obtained through business acquisitions. Acquired finitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Indefinite life intangible  assets  are  not  amortized  but  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually  or  more  often  if  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying amounts may not be recoverable. During the third quarter of 2022, a quantitative assessment of indefinite life intangible assets identified certain tradenames for which the carrying amounts might not be recoverable. As a result of this evaluation, a pre-tax impairment of $2.4 million was recognized on certain indefinite-lived tradenames. Management did not identify any circumstances to indicate that it was necessary to reevaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2022. No impairment was recognized on intangible assets in 2021.

The fair value of the indefinite-lived tradenames was estimated using the relief from royalty method, a form of the income approach. Significant judgement is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. The most significant assumptions utilized in  the  determination of the estimated fair values of the indefinite-lived tradenames were the sales projections and long-term earnings growth rates, the royalty rate and the discount rate. The long-term earnings growth rate represents the expected rate at which the brands are expected to  grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The royalty rate is based on observed market royalty rates for various industrial, consumer and commercial trademarks. The discount rate is based on our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk.

Determining the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant judgment, including judgements about the appropriate terminal growth rates, weighted average costs of capital and the amounts and timing of projected future cash flows. Fair value determinations are sensitive to changes in  underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Projected future cash flows are based on our most recent forecasts and strategic plans as well as certain growth rate assumptions. Potential changes in our costs and operating structure, the implementation of synergies, and overall  performance  in  the  automotive  aftermarket  industry,  could  negatively  impact  our  near-term  cash-flow  projections  and  could  trigger  a potential impairment of our goodwill. In addition, failure to execute our strategic plans as well as increases in weighted average costs of capital could negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit and increase the risk of future impairment charges.

## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk .  Holley is exposed to market risk in the normal course of business due to the Company's ongoing investing and financing activities. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. Holley has established policies  and  procedures governing the Company's management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks. The Company generally does not hedge its interest rate exposure. On December 31, 2022 the Company had $659.4 million of floating-rate debt outstanding under the Credit Agreement. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an approximately $6.6 million change to Holley's annual interest expense.

Credit and other Risks .  Holley is exposed to credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. On December 31, 2022,  the  majority  the  Company's  cash  and  cash  equivalents  consisted  of  cash  balances  in  non-interest-bearing  checking  accounts  which exceed the insurance coverage provided on such deposits. Substantially all trade receivable balances of the business are unsecured. The credit risk with respect to trade receivables is concentrated by the number of significant customers that the Company has in its customer base and a prolonged economic downturn could increase exposure to credit risk on the Company's trade receivables. To manage exposure to such risks, Holley performs ongoing credit evaluations of the Company's customers and maintains an allowance for potential credit losses.

Exchange Rate Sensitivity . On December 31, 2022, the Company was exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. While historically this exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates has not had a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations, foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on business and results of operations in the future. Historically, Holley's primary exposure has been related to transactions denominated in the Euros and Canadian dollars. The majority of the Company's sales, both domestically and internationally, are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Historically, the majority of the Company's expenses have also been in U.S. Dollars and we have been somewhat insulated from currency fluctuations. However, Holley may be exposed to greater exchange rate sensitivity in the future. Currently, the Company does not hedge foreign currency exposure; however, the Company may consider strategies to mitigate foreign currency exposure in the future if deemed necessary.

## Item 9A. Controls and Procedures


## (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Interim President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, on December 31, 2022. Based on their evaluation the Interim President and Chief Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  have  concluded  that  the  Company's  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  were  effective on December 31, 2022.


## (b) Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting '

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance  of  records  that  in  reasonable  detail  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  its  assets;  (ii)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of its financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that its receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.

Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management's projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company's management, under the oversight of the Interim President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting on December 31, 2022 and in making this assessment used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this  assessment, the Company's management, under the oversight of the Interim President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective on December 31, 2022.


## (c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d- 15(f) of the Exchange Act)  during  the  most  recent  fiscal  quarter  that  have  materially  affected,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  our  internal  control  over financial reporting.

## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Stockholders Holley Inc.


## Opinion on the financial statements

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Holley  Inc.  (a  Delaware  corporation)  and  subsidiaries  (the 'Company')  as  of  December  31,  2022  and  2021,  the  related  consolidated  statements  of  comprehensive  income  (loss),  changes  in stockholders'  equity,  and  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2022,  and  the  related  notes  and financial statement schedule included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results  of  its  operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2022,  in  conformity  with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


## Change in accounting principle

As discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases in 2022 due to the adoption of ASC Topic 842, Leases.


## Basis for opinion

These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ('PCAOB') and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP

We have served as the Company's auditor since 2020

## HOLLEY INC.


## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(in thousands, except share data)


## 1. Description of the Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Holley Inc., a Delaware corporation headquartered in Bowling Green, Kentucky (the 'Company' or 'Holley'), conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries. These operating subsidiaries are comprised of Holley Performance Products Inc. ('Holley Performance'), Hot Rod Brands, Inc. ('Hot Rod Brands'), Simpson Safety Solutions, Inc., B&M Racing and Performance Products, Inc., and Speedshop.com, Inc.

On July 16, 2021, (the 'Closing' and such date, the 'Closing Date') the Company consummated the business combination (the 'Business Combination') pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 11, 2021, (the 'Merger Agreement'), by and among Empower Ltd.,  ('Empower'),  Empower  Merger  Sub  I  Inc.  ('Merger  Sub  I'),  Empower  Merger  Sub  II  LLC  ('Merger  Sub  II'),  and  Holley Intermediate Holdings, Inc. ('Holley Intermediate'). On the Closing Date, Empower changed its name to Holley Inc. See Note 2, ' Business Combination, Acquisitions, and Divestiture, ' for more information.

Holley Intermediate, the predecessor to Holley, was incorporated on October 25, 2018, to effect the merger of Driven Performance Brands, Inc.  ('Driven')  and  the  purchase  of  High  Performance  Industries,  Inc.  ('HPI').  The  Company  designs,  manufactures  and  distributes performance automotive products to customers primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. The Company is a leading manufacturer of  a  diversified  line  of  performance automotive products, including carburetors, fuel pumps, fuel injection systems, nitrous oxide injection systems, superchargers, exhaust headers, mufflers, distributors, ignition components, engine tuners and automotive performance plumbing products that are produced through its two major subsidiaries, Holley Performance and Hot Rod Brands. The Company is also a leading manufacturer  of  exhaust  products  as  well  as  shifters,  converters,  transmission  kits,  transmissions,  tuners  and  automotive  software.  The Company's  products  are  designed  to  enhance  street,  off-road,  recreational  and  competitive  vehicle  performance  through  increased horsepower, torque and drivability. The Company has locations in North America, Canada, Italy and China.


## Emerging Growth Company Status

Section  102(b)(1)  of  the  JOBS  Act  exempts  emerging  growth  companies  from  being  required  to  comply  with  new  or  revised  financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company is an emerging growth company, and, as such, has elected to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period for new or revised financial accounting standards.


## Risks and Uncertainties

COVID-19  has  adversely  impacted  global  supply  chain  and  general  economic  conditions.  The  Company  has  continued  to  experience disruptions and higher costs in manufacturing, supply chain, logistical operations, and shortages of certain Company products in distribution channels. The full extent of COVID-19's effect on the Company's operational and financial performance in the future will depend on future developments, including but not limited to the duration, spread, intensity and phase of the pandemic in various countries; the emergence of COVID-19 variants and the utilization and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines against these variants; the further impact of COVID-19 on the global economy; and demand for the Company's products and services. Should the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic not improve, or worsen,  or  if  the  Company's  attempt  to  mitigate  its  impact  on  its  supply  chain,  operations  and  costs  is  not  successful,  the  Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. See Part I: Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion on the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on our business.

The Company's business and results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity are impacted by broad economic conditions including inflation,  labor  shortages,  and  disruption  of  the  supply  chain,  as  well  as  by  geopolitical  events,  including  the  conflict  in  Ukraine.  The Company's operations  have  been  adversely  impacted  by  inflationary  pressures  primarily  related  to  transportation,  labor  and  component costs. Sales growth in certain products has been constrained by continuing supply chain challenges and automotive electronic component shortages.  In  response  to  the  global  supply  chain  volatility  and  inflationary  impacts,  the  Company  has  attempted  to  minimize  potential adverse impacts on its business with cost savings initiatives, price increases to customers, and by increasing inventory levels of certain products  and  working  closely  with  its  suppliers  and  customers  to  minimize  disruptions  in  delivering  products  to  customers.  Should  the ongoing  macroeconomic  conditions  not  improve,  or  worsen,  or  if  the  Company's  attempt  to  mitigate  the  impact  on  its  supply  chain, operations and costs is not successful, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

## Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP" or 'GAAP') and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.


## Summary of Significant Accounting Policies


## Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These estimates require the use of judgment as future events, and the effect of these events, cannot be predicted with certainty. The estimates will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired and as more information is obtained. The Company evaluates and updates assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may consult outside experts to assist as considered necessary.


## Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents  include  cash  and  deposits  with  financial  institutions  with  original  maturities  less  than  90  days.  The  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures financial institution deposits up to $250. The Company maintains deposits exceeding $250 in certain accounts at financial institutions. On  December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had cash in foreign bank accounts of $5,878 and $5,765, respectively.


## Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses

Accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers in the ordinary course of business. The receivables are stated at the amount management  expects  to  collect.  The  Company  is  subject  to  risk  of  loss  from  uncollectible  receivables  in  excess  of  its  allowance.  The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses from customers' inability to make required payments. In order to estimate the appropriate level of this allowance, the Company analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current customer credit  worthiness,  current  economic  trends  and  changes  in  customer  payment  patterns.  Accounts  are  written  off  when  management determines the account is uncollectable. Interest is not charged on past due accounts.


## Inventory Valuation

The Company's inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances.


## Segments

The Company's operations are managed and reported to its Chief Executive Officer ('CEO'), the Company's chief operating decision maker, on a consolidated basis. The CEO assesses performance and allocates resources based on the consolidated results of operations. Under this organizational and reporting structure, the Company has one reportable segment.


## Goodwill

Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  purchase  price  over  the  fair  value  of  the  net  assets  of  businesses  acquired.  On  an  annual  basis  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may have been impaired, the Company may perform a qualitative  assessment  to  determine  if  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount, including goodwill. If the Company determines that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, it will perform a quantitative analysis; otherwise, no further evaluation is necessary. For the quantitative impairment assessment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit based on a weighting of income and market approaches. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the Company will recognize a loss equal to the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Impairments, if any, are charged directly to earnings.

## Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill

Tradenames acquired in certain business combinations were determined to have indefinite useful lives and are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment on an annual basis and when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may be impaired. If such review indicates an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.

As part of separate business acquisitions, the Company's customer relationships, technology and certain tradenames were identified as definite-lived intangible assets. The customer relationship intangible assets are being amortized over a ten to twenty-five year life based on the  attrition  rate  of  customers  with  a  weighted-average  amortization  period  of  23.6  years.  The  technology  intangible  assets  are  being amortized over a five to fourteen year life based on the lifecycle of previous technology with a weighted-average amortization period of 12.1 years. The tradenames are being amortized over a fifteen to twenty year life based on the estimated life of the tradename with a weightedaverage amortization period of 19.2 years. The weighted-average amortization period for all amortizable intangibles on a combined basis is 22.5 years.


## Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment acquired in various acquisitions have been recorded at fair value. All other property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided for using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives for new property, plant and equipment additions are seven years to twenty-five years for buildings and improvements and three to ten years for machinery and equipment. Maintenance, repairs, and betterments which do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are expensed as incurred.


## Leases

Operating lease right of use ("ROU") assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company's leases may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options to extend are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Some leases have variable payments,  however,  because  they  are  not  based  on  an  index  or  rate,  they  are  not  included  in  the  ROU  assets  and  liabilities.  Variable payments for real estate leases primarily relate to common area maintenance, insurance, taxes and utilities. Since the Company's leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, the Company applies a portfolio approach using an estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and other information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The rate applied is based on the currency of the lease. Leases having a lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the  related  lease  expense  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  lease.  In  addition,  the  Company  has  applied  the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all of the Company's leases. See Note 14, "Lease Commitments," for further details.


## Debt Issuance Costs

Debt  issuance  costs  include  fees  and  costs  incurred  to  obtain  financing.  Debt  issuance  costs  related  to  the  Company's  term  loans are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the term loans. These fees and costs are being amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the related loans and are included in interest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). If the debt is retired before its scheduled maturity date, any remaining unamortized debt issuance costs are written off in the period the debt is retired as a non-operating expense in the statement of operations as loss on the early extinguishment of debt. For the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, the amortization of debt issuance costs included in interest expense was $1,707, $3,182, and $3,092, respectively.


## Self-Insurance

The Company is self-insured for employee medical and prescription drug benefits up to certain stop loss coverage amounts. The Company accrues  an  estimate  for  unpaid  claims,  as  well  as  incurred  but  not  reported  claims,  based  upon  the  Company's  claim  experience  and expectations of future claim activity. The resulting liability and expense are reflected as a component of accrued expenses, cost of sales and selling, general  and  administrative  expenses  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  consolidated  statements  of comprehensive income (loss), respectively.

## Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue with customers when control of the promised goods transfers to the customer. This generally occurs when the product is shipped to the customer. Revenue is recorded at the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the delivered goods, which includes an estimate of variable consideration, expected returns, or refunds when applicable. The Company estimates variable consideration, such as sales incentives, by using the most likely amount approach, which considers the single most  likely  amount  from  a  range  of  possible  consideration  amounts.  Estimates  of  variable  consideration  result  in  an  adjustment  to  the transaction price such that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur in the future. Sales incentives and allowances are recognized as a reduction to revenue at the time of the related sale. Revenue is recorded net of sales tax. Shipping and handling  fees  billed  to  customers  are  included  in  net  sales,  while  costs  of  shipping  and  handling  are  included  in  selling,  general  and administrative costs.

For more information about the Company's revenue from contracts with customers, see Note 9, ' Revenue '.


## Customer Sales Incentives

Sales incentives provided take the form of either sales discounts or rebates and are treated as a reduction of net sales. The Company also maintains  a  cooperative  advertising  program  with  its  customers  and  provides  sales  incentives  to  the  extent  of  the  estimated  value  of advertising provided by the customer on behalf of the Company. The costs incurred under the cooperative advertising program are included as a reduction of net sales.


## Product Warranty

The Company generally warrants its products against certain manufacturing and other defects. These product warranties are provided for specific  periods  of  time  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  product.  The  accrued  product  warranty  costs  are  based  primarily  on  historical experience of actual warranty claims and are recorded at the time of the sale. These obligations are recorded within accrued liabilities in the consolidated  balance  sheets  (see  also  Note  17,  ' Commitments  and  Contingencies '  for  additional  information  on  warranty  reserves). Significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing warranty allowances in any accounting period. Revision to these estimates is made, when necessary, based upon changes in these factors.


## Sales Returns

Estimated  sales  returns  and  allowances  are  recorded  as  a  charge  against  gross  sales  in  the  period  in  which  the  related  sales  are recognized, net of returns to stock. The Company's customers are permitted to return new, undamaged products within customer-specific limits  (which  are  generally  limited  to  a  specified  percentage  of  their  annual  purchases)  in  the  event  that  they  have  overstocked  their inventories.  The  Company  estimates  sales  returns  based  primarily  upon  actual  historical  returns,  planned  product  discontinuances,  and promotional  sales.  Returned  products,  which  are  recorded  as  inventories,  are  valued  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  net  realizable  value.  The physical condition and marketability of the returned products are the major factors considered in estimating realizable value.


## Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold primarily consists of materials and labor expense in the manufacturing of the Company's products sold to its customers. Cost  of  goods  sold  also  includes  provisions  for  excess  and  obsolete  inventory,  warranty  costs,  certain  allocated  costs  for  facilities, depreciation and other manufacturing overhead.


## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  include  personnel  costs  for  employees  in  selling,  general  and  administrative  functions (including  equity-based  compensation);  costs  to  operate  branch  locations,  corporate  offices  and  back-office  support  centers;  costs  to transport  products  from  facilities  to  our  customers;  and  other  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses,  such  as  professional  fees, supplies, and advertising expenses.

## Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences  attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement  carrying  amounts  of  existing  assets  and  liabilities  and  their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

The Company recognizes income tax positions only if those positions are 'more likely than not' of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition  or  measurement  are  reflected  in  the  period  in  which  the  change  in  judgment  occurs.  The  Company  recognizes interest  on  liabilities  for  uncertain  tax  positions  in  interest  expense  and  would  recognize  penalties,  if  any,  in  operating  expenses  in  its consolidated income statements. The Company has no amounts accrued for such interest or penalties on  December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various foreign and state jurisdictions.

On  December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits. The statute of limitations remains open for U.S. federal income tax examinations for the years ended December 31, 2019, through December 31, 2021. U.S. state jurisdictions have statues  of  limitations  generally  ranging  from  three  to  eight  years.  The  Company  does  not  expect  the  total  amount  of  unrecognized  tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months.


## Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

The Company accounts for long-lived assets,  including  intangible  assets  subject  to  amortization,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  that require  long-lived  assets,  such  as  property  and  equipment,  be  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.  Recoverability  of  assets  to  be  held  and  used  is  measured  by  a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the sum of undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying  amount  of  an  asset  exceeds  its  estimated  future  cash  flows,  an  impairment  charge  is  recognized  by  the  amount  by  which  the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.


## Advertising

Advertising production costs are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Total advertising expenses were $7,159, $6,299, and $4,379 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Advertising costs are classified as a component of selling, general and administrative costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).


## Research and Development Costs

Research, development, pre-production and start-up costs related to both present and future products are expensed as incurred. Such costs amount to $29,083, $28,280, and $23,483 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.


## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive loss encompasses all changes in stockholder's equity and includes net income, change in the foreign currency translation adjustment  and  minimum  pension  liability.  The  Company's  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  shown  on  the  consolidated  balance sheets on  December 31, 2022 and 2021 consists of minimum pension loss of $0 and $302, respectively, and foreign currency translation adjustments of $ 944 and $(46), respectively.


## Foreign Currencies

The functional  currency  of  the  Company's  Italian  subsidiary  is  the  Euro. Assets  and  liabilities  of  foreign  operations  are  translated  using period end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates during each period reported. Translation gains are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of shareholders equity and were $990, $30, and $16 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company recognizes foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on certain  assets  and  liabilities.  These  transaction  (gains)  losses  are  reported  in  other  expense  in  the  consolidated  statements  of comprehensive income (loss) and were $(97), $44, and $(284) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

## Earnings per Share

Earnings  per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  net  income  or  loss  available  to  common  stockholders  by  the  weighted  average  number  of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of these potential common shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method.


## Warrants

The Company accounts for warrants to purchase its common stock as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant's specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging .  The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC Topic 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC Topic 480, and whether the warrants  meet  all  of  the  requirements  for  equity  classification  under ASC  Topic  815,  including  whether  the  warrants  are  indexed  to  the Company's own shares and whether the warrant holders could potentially require 'net cash settlement' in a circumstance outside of the Company's control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.


## Equity-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for equity-based awards granted to employees and nonemployees under the fair value method prescribed by ASC Subtopic 718-10, Stock Compensation .  Equity-based compensation cost is measured based on the estimated grant date fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period). The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.

The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. Restricted stock units are valued at the stock price on the grant date. The fair value of profit interest units ("PIUs") granted by the Holley Stockholder is estimated based on the Company's estimated equity value for each unit class at the time of granting using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, discounted to reflect market considerations for illiquidity.


## Fair Value Measurements

Fair  value  is  defined  as  the  price  that  would  be  received  for  sale  of  an  asset  or  paid  for  transfer  of  a  liability,  in  an  orderly  transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized based on a three-level hierarchy, which are defined as follows:

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.

Level 2 - Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3 - Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.


## Derivative Financial Instruments

The  Company  evaluates  its  financial  instruments  to  determine  if  such  instruments  are  derivatives  or  contain  features  that  qualify  as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. Derivative liabilities are classified on the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

## Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial  instruments,  which  potentially  subject  the  Company  to  significant  concentrations  of  credit  risk,  consist  primarily  of  cash  and accounts  receivable.  The  Company  controls  its  exposure  to  credit  risk  associated  with  these  instruments  by  (i)  placing  cash  and  cash equivalents with several major financial institutions and (ii) maintaining strict policies over credit extension that include credit evaluations, credit limits and monitoring procedures. For more information on the Company's net sales to its three largest customers, see Note 15, ' Major Reseller Customers '.


## Recent Accounting Pronouncements


## Accounting Standards Recently Adopted

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets, representing their right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance effective  January  1,  2022,  using  the  modified  retrospective  optional  transition  method.  Therefore,  the  standard  was  applied  beginning January 1, 2022, and prior periods were not restated. The adoption of the standard did not result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company elected the package of practical expedients and implemented internal controls and executed changes to business processes to enable the preparation of financial information upon adoption. The adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of a right of use asset and short-term and long-term liabilities recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet related  to  operating  leases.  In  addition,  the  adoption  of  the  standard  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  results  of operations or cash flows. See Note 14, "Lease Commitments," for further details.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation - Retirements Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20) . The ASU  will  update  disclosure  requirements  for  employers  that  sponsor  defined  benefit  pension  or  other  post  retirement  plans.  The Company adopted ASU 2018-14 on a retrospective basis as of  January  1,  2022. Adoption  did  not  result  in  a  significant  change  to  the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740), which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. The ASU removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2022. Adoption of the ASU did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 470-20) . ASU 2020-06 eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models for convertible instruments. The new guidance modifies how particular convertible instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS computation. It also amends the accounting for certain contracts in an entity's own equity that are currently accounted for as derivatives because of specific settlement provisions. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022. Adoption of the ASU did not impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), as further modified by ASU 2021-01 and ASU 202206 (collectively, the "ASUs"). The ASUs provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions, if certain conditions are met, for applying GAAP  to  contracts,  hedging  relationships,  and  other  transactions  affected  by  the  transition  from  the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate ("LIBOR") and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). The standard  is  currently  applicable  to  contracts  entered  into  before  January  1,  2025.  The ASUs  were  effective  upon  issuance  and  allowed companies to adopt the amendments on a prospective basis through December 31, 2022. The Company has not adopted any expedients or exceptions under ASU 2020-04.

## Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In  October  2021,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2021-08, Business  Combinations  (Topic  805):  Accounting  for  Contract  Assets  and  Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers .  This ASU requires entities to apply the definition of a performance obligation under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ,  to  recognize  and  measure  contract  assets  and  contract  liabilities  (i.e.,  deferred  revenue) relating to contracts with customers that are acquired in a business combination. Under current U.S. GAAP, an acquirer generally recognizes assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract liabilities arising from revenue contracts with customers, at fair value on the acquisition date. ASU No. 2021-08 will result in the acquirer recording acquired contract assets and liabilities on the same basis that would have been recorded by the acquiree before the acquisition under ASC Topic 606. Adoption of the provisions of ASU 2021-08 are effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its financial statements.


## 2. BUSINESS COMBINATION, ACQUISITIONS, AND DIVESTITURE


## BUSINESS COMBINATION

On July 16, 2021, Holley consummated the Business Combination pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, whereby (i) Merger Sub I, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Empower, merged with and into Holley Intermediate, with Holley Intermediate surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holley ('Merger I') and (ii) Merger Sub II, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Empower, merged with and into Holley Intermediate, with Merger Sub II surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holley ('Merger II').

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Closing, all outstanding shares of Holley Intermediate common stock as of immediately prior to the effective time of Merger I were cancelled and the Holley Stockholder, the sole stockholder of Holley Intermediate, received $264,718 in cash and 67,673,884 shares of common stock (at a deemed value of $10.00 per share). The Company's common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol 'HLLY.'

In connection with the Business Combination, a number of subscribers purchased from the Company an aggregate of 24,000,000 shares of common stock (the 'PIPE'), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share, or $240,000 in the aggregate. Per the Merger Agreement, $100,000 of the PIPE proceeds were used to partially pay off Holley's debt.

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Forward Purchase Agreement ('A&R FPA'), at the Closing, 5,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock and 1,666,667 warrants were issued to certain investors for an aggregate purchase price of $50,000. Pursuant to the A&R FPA, each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of the Company's common stock at a price of $11.50 per share (the 'Public Warrants'), subject to certain conditions.

The Company also assumed 8,333,310 Public Warrants and 4,666,667 private placement warrants (the 'Private Warrants', and together with  the  Public  Warrants,  the  'Warrants')  upon  the  Business  Combination,  all  of  which  were  issued  in  connection  with  Empower's  initial public offering. Each Warrant represents the right to purchase one share of the Company's common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain conditions. The Warrants are exercisable commencing on October 9, 2021 (the one-year anniversary of Empower's initial public offering) and expire on July 16, 2026 (five years after the Closing Date). The Public Warrants are listed on the NYSE under the symbol 'HLLY WS.'

Additionally, Empower Sponsor Holdings LLC (the "Sponsor") received 2,187,500 shares of the Company's common stock, which vest in two equal tranches upon achieving certain market share price milestones as outlined in the Merger Agreement during the earn-out period ('the 'Earn-Out Shares'). The first tranche of Earn-Out Shares vested during the first quarter of 2022. Upon vesting, the first tranche of the EarnOut Shares, or 1,093,750 shares, were issued and a liability of $14,689, representing the fair value of the shares on the date of vesting, was reclassified from liabilities to equity. The remaining tranche of Earn-Out Shares will be forfeited if the applicable conditions are not satisfied before July 16, 2028 (seven years after the Closing Date). The remaining Earn-Out Shares are classified as a liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet and are remeasured at fair value with changes in the post-Business Combination fair value recognized in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income as non-operating expense.

The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This determination was primarily based  on  the  Holley  Stockholder  having  a  relative  majority  of  the  voting  power  of  the  Company,  the  operations  of  Holley  prior  to  the acquisition comprising the only ongoing operations of the Company, and senior management of Holley comprising the majority of the senior management of the Company. Under this method of accounting, Empower was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting. Accordingly,  the  Business  Combination  was  accounted  for  as  the  equivalent  of  Holley  issuing  stock  for  the  net  assets  of  Empower, accompanied by a recapitalization. The  net  assets  of  Empower  are  stated  at  historical  cost,  with  no  goodwill  or  other  intangible  assets recorded.  Reported  amounts  from  operations  included  herein  prior  to  the  Business  Combination  are  those  of  Holley  Intermediate.  The shares and corresponding capital amounts and earnings per share, prior to the Business Combination, have been retroactively restated based on shares received by the Holley Stockholder.

The following table reconciles the elements of the Business Combination to the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021:

## ACQUISITIONS

During the three years ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed 14 acquisitions. These acquisitions are expected to enhance the Company's portfolio of products and services in the automotive aftermarket and automotive safety solutions market.

The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method, and accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated based upon the  fair  value  of  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.  The  valuation  of  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  is  subject  to revision. If additional information becomes available, the Company may further revise the purchase price allocation as soon as practical, but no later than one year from the acquisition date; however, material changes are not expected. Goodwill generated by the acquisitions is primarily attributable to the strong market position of the entities acquired.

Purchase price consideration for all acquisitions was paid primarily in cash. All acquisitions were for 100 percent of the acquired business and  are  reported  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash  Flows,  net  of  acquired  cash  and  cash  equivalents. Acquisition-related  costs, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other costs, are typically expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred and are recorded in acquisition and restructuring costs. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.

In 2022, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of John's Ind., Inc. ("John's"), Southern Kentucky Classics ("SKC"), and Vesta Motorsports USA, Inc., doing business as RaceQuip ("RaceQuip"). These acquisitions were immaterial business combinations. Cash paid for the three acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $14,863, and was funded with borrowings from the Company's credit facility and cash on  hand.  The  acquisitions  resulted  in  both  amortizable  and  nonamortizable  intangibles  and  goodwill  totaling  $9,618.  The  goodwill  and intangibles  generated  as  a  result  of  these  acquisitions  are  deductible  for  income  tax  purposes.  Pro  forma  results  of  operations  and  the results of operations since the acquisition dates for these immaterial acquisitions have not been separately disclosed because the effects were not significant compared to the consolidated financial statements, individually or in the aggregate.

The final allocation of the purchase price to specific assets acquired and liabilities assumed may change in future periods as the fair value estimates of inventory and intangibles are completed. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets as follows:

The fair  value  of  the  acquired  customer  relationship  intangible  asset  was  estimated  using  the  excess  earnings  approach. The  customer relationship intangible asset is being amortized based on the attrition rate of customers which was determined to be 20 years. The fair value of  the  acquired  tradenames  intangible  asset  was  estimated  using  the  relief  from  royalty  method,  a  form  of  the  income  approach.  The tradenames were determined to have an indefinite life.

In 2021, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of Finspeed, LLC ('Finspeed'), Classic Instruments LLC ('Classic Instruments'), ADS Precision Machining, Inc., doing business as Arizona Desert Shocks ('ADS'), Rocket Performance Machine, Inc., doing business as Rocket  Racing  Wheels  ('Rocket'),  and  Speartech  Fuel  Injections  Systems,  Inc.  ('Speartech').  These  five  acquisitions  were  individually immaterial business combinations that are material in the aggregate. Cash paid for the five immaterial acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was  $19,909,  and  was  funded  with  borrowings  from  the  Company's  credit  facility  and  cash  on  hand.  The  acquisitions  resulted  in  both amortizable  and  non-amortizable  intangibles  and  goodwill  totaling  $13,247.  The  goodwill  and  intangibles  generated  as  a  result  of  these acquisitions are deductible for income tax purposes. Pro forma results of operations and the results of operations since the acquisition dates for these immaterial acquisitions have not been separately disclosed because the effects were not significant compared to the consolidated financial statements, individually or in the aggregate.


The determination of the final purchase price allocation to specific assets acquired and liabilities assumed was adjusted to reflect the final fair value estimate of acquired assets and liabilities, as noted below.

The fair value of the acquired customer relationship intangible assets was estimated using the excess earnings approach. The customer relationship intangible assets are being amortized based on the attrition rate of customers which have an estimated weighted average life of 18 years. The fair  value  of  the  acquired  tradenames  intangible  asset  was  estimated  using  the  relief  from  royalty  method,  a  form  of  the income approach. The tradenames were determined to have an indefinite life.

The remaining six acquisitions completed during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are described below.


# Baer, Inc.

On December 23, 2021, the Company acquired substantially  all  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  Baer,  Inc.,  doing  business  as  Baer  Brakes ("Baer").  Consideration  for  the  assets  acquired  was  cash  payments  of  $22,170.  The  acquisition  resulted  in  both  amortizable  and  nonamortizable intangibles and goodwill totaling $18,989. The goodwill and intangibles generated as a result of this acquisition are deductible for income tax purposes. The purchase price was funded with borrowings from the Company's credit facility and cash on hand.

The determination of the final purchase price allocation to specific assets acquired and liabilities assumed was adjusted to reflect the final fair value estimate of acquired assets and liabilities, as noted below. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets as follows:

The fair value of the acquired customer relationship intangible asset was estimated using the excess earnings approach. The customer relationship intangible asset is being amortized based on the attrition rate of customers which was determined to be 10 years. The fair value of the acquired tradenames intangible asset was estimated using the relief from royalty method, a form of the income approach. The tradenames were determined to have an indefinite life.

The contractual value of the accounts receivable acquired was $418.

Goodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the Company's business combinations. The measurement period for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed ends as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date becomes available, not to exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined. In the  third  quarter  and  fourth  quarters  of  2022,  the  Company  performed  quantitative  and  qualitative  assessments  and  did  not  identify  any indicators of impairment. No impairment changes were incurred during 2022 and 2021.

The following outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held on  December 31, 2022:
| 2023       | $ 14,557   |
|------------|------------|
| 2024       | 13,744     |
| 2025       | 13,714     |
| 2026       | 13,608     |
| 2027       | 13,493     |
| Thereafter | 180,741    |
| Total      | $ 249,857  |


In  the  third  quarter  of  2022,  management  concluded  it  was  necessary  to  reevaluate  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  for  impairment after  supply  chain  challenges  led  to  the  Company  revising  its  earnings  estimate  for  2022,  which  resulted  in  a  decline  in  the  Company's market capitalization. As a result of this evaluation, a pre-tax impairment of $2,395 was recognized on certain indefinite-lived tradenames. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets and did not identify any indicators of impairment.

The  fair  value  of  the  indefinite-lived  tradenames  was  estimated  using  the  relief  from  royalty  method,  a  form  of  the  income  approach. Significant judgement is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in performing impairment tests. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the indefinite-lived tradenames were the sales projections and longterm earnings growth rates, the royalty rate and the discount rate. The long-term earnings growth rate represents the expected rate at which the brands are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The royalty rate is based on observed market royalty rates for various industrial, consumer and commercial trademarks. The discount rate is based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future sales, actual results in the future may vary significantly from the forecasts.

Potential  changes  in  our  costs  and  operating  structure,  the  implementation  of  synergies,  and  overall  performance  in  the  automotive aftermarket  industry,  could  negatively  impact  our  near-term  cash-flow  projections  and  could  trigger  a  potential  impairment  of  the Company's  goodwill  and  /  or  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets.  In  addition,  failure  to  execute  the  Company's  strategic  plans  as  well  as increases  in  weighted  average  costs  of  capital  could  negatively  impact  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  and  increase  the  risk  of future impairment charges.

On November 18, 2021, the Company entered into a credit facility with a syndicate of lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders, letter of credit issuer and swing line lender (the "Credit Agreement"). The financing consists of a seven-year $600,000 first lien term loan, a five-year $125,000 revolving credit facility, and a $100,000 delayed draw term loan. The proceeds of any delayed draw loans made after closing were available to the Company to finance acquisitions. Upon the expiration of the delayed draw term loan in May 2022, the Company had drawn $57,000, which is included in the amount outstanding under the first lien term loan due November 17, 2028.

The revolving credit facility includes a letter of credit facility in the amount of $10,000, pursuant to which letters of credit may be issued as long  as  revolving  loans  may  be  advanced  and  subject  to  availability  under  the  revolving  credit  facility.  The  Company  had  $1,200  in outstanding letters of credit on  December 31, 2022.

Proceeds from the credit facility were used to repay in full the Company's obligations under its existing first lien and second lien notes and to pay $13,413 in original issue discount and issuance costs related to the refinancing.

The first lien term loan is to be repaid in quarterly payments of $1,643 through September 30, 2028, with the balance due upon maturity on November 17, 2028. Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company is required to pay down the term loan by an amount equal to 50% of annual excess cash flow, as defined in the Credit Agreement. This percentage requirement may decrease or be eliminated if certain leverage ratios are achieved. Based on our results for 2022, no excess cash flow payment is expected to be required in 2023. Any such payments offset future mandatory quarterly payments.

Amounts outstanding under the credit facility will accrue interest at a rate equal to either the London Interbank Offering Rate ("LIBOR") or base rate, at the Company's election, plus a specified margin. LIBOR is expected to be phased out by June 2023. The Company's LIBORbased borrowings under the credit facility contemplate a transition from LIBOR to an alternative index. In the case of revolving credit loans and  letter  of  credit  fees,  the  specified  margin  is  based  on  the  Company's  Total  Leverage  Ratio,  as  defined  in  the  Credit  Agreement. Commitment fees payable under the revolving credit facility are based on the Company's Total Leverage Ratio. On  December 31, 2022, the weighted average interest rate on the Company's borrowings under the credit facility was 8.4%.

Obligations  under  the  Credit  Agreement  are  secured  by  substantially  all  of  the  Company's  assets.  The  Credit  Agreement  includes representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type, including, but not limited to, limitations on restricted payments, additional borrowings, additional investments, and asset sales. The Credit Agreement also requires that Holley maintain on the last day of each quarter, a Total Leverage Ratio not to exceed a maximum amount. On  December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.

In February 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement which, among other things, increases the consolidated net leverage ratio financial covenant level applicable under the Credit Agreement as of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023 through the fiscal  quarter ending March 31, 2024 (the 'Covenant Relief Period'), to initially 7.25:1.00, and provides for modified step-down levels for such covenant thereafter. As an ongoing condition to the covenant relief period, the Company also agreed to (i) a minimum liquidity test, (ii) an interest coverage test, (iii) an anti-cash hoarding test at any time revolving loans are outstanding, and (iv) additional reporting obligations. Under the  amended Credit Agreement,  the  revolving  credit  facility  contains  a  minimum  liquidity  financial  covenant  of  $45  million,  which includes unrestricted cash and any available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility.

Some of the lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement, and their respective affiliates, have various relationships with the Company in the ordinary course of business involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, commercial banking, investment banking or other services.

## 7. COMMON STOCK WARRANTS

Upon the Closing, there were 14,666,644 Warrants, consisting of 9,999,977 Public Warrants and 4,666,667 Private Warrants, outstanding to purchase shares of the Company's common stock that were issued by Empower prior to the Business Combination. Each warrant entitles the  registered  holder  to  purchase  one  share  of  the  Company's  common  stock  at  a  price  of  $11.50  per  share,  subject  to  adjustments, commencing on October 9, 2021 (the one-year anniversary of Empower's initial public offering), provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder. The Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of the Company's common stock. The Warrants expire on July 16, 2026, the date that is five years after the Closing date, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Additionally, the Private Warrants will be non-redeemable and are exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor or any of its permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.

The Company may redeem the Public Warrants at a price of $0.01 per warrant upon 30 days' notice if the closing price of the Company's common  stock  equals  or  exceeds  $18.00  per  share,  subject  to  adjustments,  on  the  trading  day  prior  to  the  date  on  which  notice  of redemption is given, provided there is an effective registration statement and current prospectus in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying  such  Warrants  throughout  the  30-day  redemption  period.  If  the  foregoing  conditions  are  satisfied  and  the  Company  issues  a notice of redemption of the Warrants, the Warrant holder is entitled to exercise his, her or its Warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. Any such exercise requires the Warrant holder to pay the exercise price for each Warrant being exercised.

Further,  the  Company  may  redeem  the  Public  Warrants  at  a  price  of  $0.10  per  warrant  upon  30  days'  notice  if  the  closing  price  of  the Company's common stock equals or exceeds $10.00 per share, subject to adjustments, on the trading day prior to the date on which notice of redemption is given. Beginning on the date the notice of redemption is given until the Warrants are redeemed or exercised, holders may elect to exercise their Warrants on a cashless basis and receive that number of shares of the Company's common stock as determined by reference to a table in the warrant agreement.

During any period when the Company has failed to maintain an effective registration statement, warrant holders may exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption, but the Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.

The Company's Warrants were accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity , and are presented as warrant liability on the balance sheet. The warrant liability was measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value recognized as non-operating expense. On  December 31, 2022 and 2021, a warrant liability with a fair value of $4,272 and $61,293, respectively, was reflected as a long-term liability in the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 14,633,311 and 14,666,644 Warrants outstanding, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $57,021 in the fair value of the warrant liability as compared to an increase of $32,580 in the fair value of the warrant liability for the year ended  December 31, 2021, was reflected as change in fair value of warrant liability in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

On  December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's derivative liabilities for its private and public warrants and the earn-out liability (see Note 2, ' Business Combination, Acquisitions, and Divestiture ,' for more details) are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value for the  private  warrants,  earn-out  liability,  and  acquisition  contingent  consideration  payable  are  determined  based  on  significant  inputs  not observable in the market (Level 3). The valuation of the Level 3 liabilities uses assumptions and estimates the Company believes would be made by a market participant in making the same valuation. The Company assesses these assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis as additional data impacting the assumptions and estimates are obtained. The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of its private warrants and earn-out liability. The fair value of the public warrants is determined using publicly traded prices (Level 1). Changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities related to warrants and the earn-out liability are recognized as non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Changes in the fair value of acquisition contingent consideration payable are recognized as acquisition and restructuring costs in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).


The fair value of private warrants was estimated at December 31, 2022 and 2021 using the Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions:
|                           | 2022     | 2021    |
|---------------------------|----------|---------|
| Valuation date price      | $ 2.12   | $ 12.99 |

| Remaining life (in years) | 3.54     | 4.54    |
| Expected dividend         | $ -    $ | -       |
| Risk-free interest rate   | 4.06%    | 1.19%   |
| Price threshold           | $ 18.00  | $ 18.00 |



The fair  value  of  the  earn-out  liability  was  estimated  at  December  31,  2022  and  2021  using  the  Monte  Carlo  simulation  model  with  the following assumptions:
|                          | 2022           | 2021    |

On  December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses for which the carrying value  approximates  fair  value  due  to  the  short-term  nature  of  these  instruments.  The  carrying  value  of  the  Company's  long-term  debt approximates fair value as the rates used approximate the market rates currently available to the Company. Fair value measurements used in the impairment reviews of goodwill and intangible assets are Level 3 measurements.

The reconciliation of changes in Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:

## 9. REVENUE

The principal activity from which the Company generates its revenue is the manufacturing and distribution of after-market automotive parts for its customers, comprised of resellers and end users. The Company recognizes revenue at a point in time, rather than over time, as the performance obligation is satisfied when customer obtains control of the product upon title transfer and not as the product is manufactured or developed.  The  amount  of  revenue  recognized  is  based  on  the  purchase  order  price  and  adjusted  for  revenue  allocated  to  variable consideration (i.e., estimated rebates, co-op advertising, etc.).

The Company collects sales tax and other taxes concurrent with revenue-producing activities which are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs incurred after control of the product is transferred to our customers are treated as fulfillment costs and not a separate performance obligation.

The Company allows customers to return products when certain Company-established criteria are met. These sales returns are recorded as a charge against gross sales in the period in which the related sales are recognized, net of returns to stock. Returned products, which are recorded as inventories, are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The physical condition and marketability of the returned products are the major factors considered in estimating realizable value. The Company also estimates expected sales returns and records the necessary adjustment as a charge against gross sales.

The Company's payment terms with customers are customary and vary by customer and geography but typically range from 30 to 365 days. The Company elected the practical expedient to disregard the possible existence of a significant financing component related to payment on contracts, as the Company expects that customers will pay for the products within one year. The Company has evaluated the terms of our arrangements and determined that they do not contain significant financing components. Additionally, as all contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, the Company has elected the practical expedient to exclude disclosure of information regarding the aggregate amount and future timing of performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period. The Company provides limited warranties on most of its products against certain manufacturing and other defects. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. Refer to Note 17, ' Commitments and Contingencies ' for more information.

Based on the Company's projected pretax earnings, reversal of deferred tax liabilities and other relevant factors, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company's deferred tax assets on  December 31, 2022 and 2021 will be realized.

On  December 31, 2022, the Company's federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were immaterial. A majority of the U.S. net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various  dates  through  2035. The  entire  amount  of  federal  net  operating  loss  carryforward  of  $625  and  a  significant  portion  of  state  net operating loss carryforward of $868 relate to acquisitions, and, as a result, are limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year.


## Uncertain Tax Positions

Under the accounting rules for income taxes, the Company is not permitted to recognize the tax benefit attributable to a tax position unless such position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, including resolution of any related appeals and litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position. The Company did not have any uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The  Company  recognizes  interest  on  liabilities  for  uncertain  tax  positions  in  interest  expense  and  would  recognize  penalties,  if  any,  in operating expenses in its consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). In 2022 and 2021, the Company has not recognized any amount of interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions in its consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

The Company files federal, state, and non-U.S. tax returns in various foreign jurisdictions. For state and non-U.S. tax returns, the Company is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2013. For federal tax returns, the Company is no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2018. The federal tax returns for 2019 through 2021 remain open for examinations. State income tax returns remain open for examination in various states for tax years 2013 through 2021.

The Company's tax policy is to comply with the laws, regulations, and filing requirements of all jurisdictions in which it conducts business. Management regularly engages in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible, that certain U.S. federal and non-U.S. tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could significantly increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. However, the estimated impact of income tax expense and net income is not expected to be significant.

# 12. BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has a defined benefit pension plan (the 'Plan') for its employees. The Projected Unit Credit Actuarial Cost Method is used to determine the normal cost of the Plan and estimated pension benefit obligation. During 2002, the Plan was amended to curtail accrual of future benefits under the Plan. The pension plan assets are managed to maximize total return over the long term while providing sufficient liquidity and current return to satisfy the cash flow requirements of the plan. The plan's day-to-day investment decisions are managed by our outside investment manager; however, overall investment strategies are discussed with our employee benefits committee. Our investment strategy is to weight our portfolio towards large-cap, high-quality, dividend-growing equities that we have historically favored. As our plan matures and interest rates normalize, we expect a greater allocation to fixed-income securities to better align asset and liability market risks. Our fixed-maturity bond portfolio is investment grade. The plan does not engage in derivative transactions.

On  January  28,  2022,  the  Company  approved  the  termination  of  its  defined  benefit  pension  plan,  effective  March  31,  2022.  The  final distribution  of  Plan  assets  pursuant  to  the  termination  was  not  made  until  the  plan  termination  satisfied  all  regulatory  requirements  in the fourth quarter of 2022. Plan participants received their accrued benefits from plan assets by electing either lump sum distributions or annuity contracts with a qualifying third-party annuity provider. The resulting settlement effect of the Plan termination was determined based on prevailing market conditions, the lump sum offer participation rate of eligible participants, the actual lump sum distributions, and annuity purchase rates at the date of distribution. As a result, the Plan recognized a final settlement loss of $154.

The following table shows the changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets and the plan's funded status.

In  order  to  develop  the  expected  long-term  rate  of  return  on  assets  assumption,  the  Company  considered  the  historical  returns  and  the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio. The fair value of Plan assets on  December 31, 2022, was zero. The fair value of Plan assets on  December 31, 2021, by asset category using the Fair Value measurement hierarchy is shown in the table below. See Note 1, ' Description  of  the  Business,  Basis  of  Presentation,  and  Summary  of Significant Accounting Policies ,' for more details about fair value measurements.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.

Common Stock : The fair value of common stock investments is determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1 inputs).

Mutual  Funds :  The  fair  value  of  mutual  fund  investments  is  determined  by  obtaining  quoted  prices  on  nationally  recognized  securities exchanges (Level 1 inputs).

Corporate/government bonds : The fair value of corporate/government bonds is based upon recent bid prices or the average of the recent bid and ask prices when available (Level 2 inputs) and if not available, they are valued through matrix pricing models developed by sources considered by management to be reliable. Matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique commonly used to price debt securities that are not actively traded, values debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs).


## 401(k) Plan

The Company has 401(k) savings plan for salaried and non-salaried employees. Participation in the plan is optional. The Company matches employee contributions up to 3.5% each pay period. The Company's matching contributions for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, include additional discretionary matching contributions of 1% based on the Company's performance targets for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company made matching contributions of $2,990, $2,579, and $1,997 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

# 13. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

In 2021, the Company adopted the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the '2021 Plan'), which provides for the grant of restricted stock awards, incentive and nonqualified stock options, and other share-based awards to employees, directors and non-employees. On  December 31, 2022, the Company had 8,850,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance and 5,816,705 shares available for future grants under the 2021 Plan.


## Stock Options

Stock option grants generally have an exercise price at least equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, have  ten-year  terms,  and  vest  ratably  over  three  years  of  continued  employment.  In  general,  vested  options  expire  if  not  exercised  at termination of service. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $4.65 and $3.88, respectively.

The following table presents a summary of stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2022:

Compensation expense for stock options is recorded based on straight-line amortization of the grant date fair value over the requisite service period. On  December 31, 2022, there was $4,085 of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options that is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 1.79 years.


The fair value of each stock option granted in 2022 and 2021 was estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
|                                | For the years ended December 31,   | For the years ended December 31,   |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|

| Expected volatility            | 36.0% - 40.0%                      | 40.3%                              |
| Expected dividend              | -                                  | -                                  |
| Risk-free interest rate        | 1.98% - 3.06%                      | 0.94%                              |

The expected term has been estimated using a simplified method, which calculates the expected term as the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual life of the awards since the Company does not have an extended history of actual exercises. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero since the Company has never paid dividends and does not have current plans to pay any dividends. The riskfree interest rate is based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options. Expected volatility is based on an evenly weighted blend of implied volatility and historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies since the Company has limited historical volatility.


# Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock units ('RSUs') vest ratably over one to three years of continued employment. The fair value of a RSU at the grant date is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $5.87 and $12.06, respectively. The total fair value of shares vested on the vesting date during the year ended December 31, 2022, was $3,497.

The following table summarizes activities for the Company's unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2022:

Table of Contents


|                   | Unvested Restricted Stock Units   | Unvested Restricted Stock Units        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|                   | Number of RSUs                    | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value |
| December 31, 2021 | 656,485    $                      | 12.06                                  |
| Granted           | 868,853                           | 5.87                                   |
| Vested            | (303,283)                         | 12.06                                  |
| Forfeited         | (113,725)                         | 12.13                                  |
| December 31, 2022 | 1,108,330    $                    | 9.43                                   |


Compensation expense for RSUs is recorded based on amortization of the grant date fair market value over the period the restrictions lapse. On  December 31, 2022, there was $6,262 of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs that is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 1.77 years.


## Profit Interest Units

The Holley Stockholder authorized an incentive pool of 41,400,000 units of Holley Stockholder that its management has the right to grant to certain employees of the Company. As of December 31, 2022, no units are available for grant. The units, which are designated as PIU's, are a special type of limited liability company equity unit that allows the recipient to potentially participate in a future increase in the value of the Company. The PIUs were issued for no consideration and generally provided for  vesting  over  a  requisite  service  period,  subject  to  the recipient remaining an employee of the Company through each vesting date. Compensation expense related to PIUs is recorded based on the grant-date fair value over the requisite service period.

In  October  2022,  the  Holley  Stockholder  amended  the  vesting  criteria  to  allow  for  immediate  vesting  of  all  outstanding  and  unvested units. The changes to these awards were deemed to be modification events under ASC Subtopic 718-10, Stock Compensation . Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized catch-up equity-based compensation expense, including incremental fair value resulting from the modification, as applicable to each award grant, amounting to a cumulative adjustment of $11,351 presented in selling, general and administrative expenses.

For  the  years  ended  December  31,  2022,  2021  and  2020,  36,506,814,  1,693,804,  and  1,697,071  PIUs  vested  with  total  grant-date  fair values of $20,276, $535, and $487, respectively. On  December 31, 2022, all PIUs were vested and all compensation expense related to the PIUs has been recognized.


The Holley Stockholder's previously granted PIUs included 24,074,944 units that contained certain performance vesting criteria related to the attainment  of  specified  levels  of  return  for  certain  other  investors  in  the  Holley  Stockholder  and  the  occurrence  of  certain  events. Compensation  expense  for  these  performance-based  awards  was  not  previously  recognized,  as  meeting  the  necessary  performance conditions for vesting was not considered probable. The early vesting of these awards was classified as a Type III: Improbable to Probable modification event under ASC Subtopic 718-10, and the fair value of the modified awards was estimated on the modification date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of PIUs is affected by estimates involving inherent uncertainties, as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include the fair value of the equity unit classes, value adjustments for a reduction in marketability, expected unit price volatility over the expected term of the units, unit redemption and cancellation  behaviors,  risk-free  interest  rates  and  expected  dividends. The  fair  value  of  PIUs  was  estimated  on  the  grant  date  with  the following assumptions:
|                                | For the years ended December 31,   | For the years ended December 31,   | For the years ended December 31,   |

| Expected dividend              | -                                  | -                                  | -                                  |
| Risk-free interest rate        | 4.3%                               | 0.3%                               | 0.3%                               |


The expected term has been estimated based on the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future unit holder behavior. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero since the Company has never paid dividends and does not have current plans to pay any dividends. The risk-free interest rate is based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. As the Holley Stockholder is a private company and does not have a trading history for its equity units, the expected price volatility for the equity units is estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for industry peers. Industry peers, which the Company has designated, consist of several public companies in the industry similar in size, stage of life cycle and financial leverage.


The  components  of  share-based  compensation  expense,  included  within  selling,  general  and  administrative  costs  in  the  consolidated statements of comprehensive income, is as follows:
|                        | For the years ended December 31,   | For the years ended December 31,   | For the years ended December 31,   |

# 14. LEASE COMMITMENTS

On January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases , using the modified retrospective optional transition method provided by ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) . The effect of applying this guidance resulted in an increase in noncurrent assets for right-of-use assets of$33,887  and  an  increase  in  liabilities  for  associated  lease  obligations  of  $34,579,  most  of  which  were  classified  as  noncurrent.  The adoption of the standard did not result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.


Under the transition option elected by the Company, ASC Topic 842 is applied only to the most current period and reporting for comparative periods  presented  in  the  financial  statements  continues  to  be  in  accordance  with ASC  Topic  840, Leases ,  including  disclosures.  Upon adoption, the Company elected the following practical expedients related to ASC 842:
- · not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases;
- · to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all of the Company's leases; and
- · to apply accounting similar to ASC Topic 840 to leases that meet the definition of short-term leases.


The  Company  leases  retail  stores,  manufacturing,  distribution,  engineering,  and  research  and  development  facilities,  office  space, equipment, and automobiles under operating lease agreements. Leases have remaining lease terms of one to 14 years, inclusive of renewal options  that  the  Company  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise.  Taxes,  insurance  and  maintenance  expenses  relating  to  all  leases  are obligations of the Company.

The following table summarizes operating lease assets and obligations:

## 17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is a party to various lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business. While the lawsuits and claims against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of the matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.

The Company generally warrants its products against certain manufacturing and other defects. These product warranties are provided for specific  periods  of  time  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  product.  The  accrued  product  warranty  costs  are  based  primarily  on  historical experience of actual warranty claims and are recorded at the time of the sale.

The following table provides the changes in the Company's accrual for product warranties, which is classified as a component of accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

# 8. RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS.

(a) CONFIDENTIALITY. During the course of Executive's employment with the Company, Executive has had and will have access to Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, 'Confidential Information' means all non-public, confidential, or proprietary materials, data, information, ideas, concepts, discoveries, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable or reduced to practice), innovations, improvements, know-how, developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models, plans and strategies, and all other confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets all of the foregoing in any form or medium (whether merely remembered or embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter existing, relating to or arising from the past, current or potential business, activities and/or operations of the Company or any of its Affiliates (or any of their respective predecessors, successors or permitted assigns), including, without limitation, any such information relating to or concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing, personnel, customers, suppliers, vendors, partners and/or competitors, and any Inventions. Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive's assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either during the period of Executive's employment or at any time thereafter, any Confidential Information or other confidential or proprietary information received from third parties subject to a duty on the Company's or its subsidiaries' or Affiliates' part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to use such information only for certain limited purposes strictly for the benefit of the Company or any of its Affiliates. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain strictly confidential, and Executive hereby agrees not to disclose the terms and conditions hereof to any person or entity, other than immediate family members, legal advisors or personal tax or financial advisors, or, solely for the purpose of disclosing the limitations on Executive's conduct imposed by the provisions of this Section 8, prospective future employers who, in each case, agree in writing to keep such information confidential consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) NONCOMPETITION. Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive performs services of a unique nature for the Company that are irreplaceable, and that Executive's performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company, (ii) Executive has had and will continue to have access to Confidential Information, which, if disclosed, would unfairly and inappropriately assist in competition against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) in the course of Executive's employment by a competitor, Executive would inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company and its subsidiaries have substantial relationships with their customers and Executive has had and will continue to have access to these customers, (v) Executive has received and will receive specialized training from the Company and its subsidiaries, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the Company and its subsidiaries in the course of Executive's employment. Accordingly, during the Employment Term and for one (1) year thereafter, Executive agrees that Executive will not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, be employed by (whether as an employee, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise, and

# Page 100

whether or not for compensation) or render services to any person, firm, corporation or other entity, in whatever form, engaged in competition with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or in any other material business in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is engaged on the date of termination or in which they have actively planned, on or prior to such date, to be engaged in on or after such date, in any locale of any country in which the Company conducts business or plans to conduct business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from being a passive owner of not more than two percent (2%) of the equity securities of a publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in competition with the Company or any of its subsidiaries, so long as Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation. For purposes of this Agreement, "control" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct, or cause the direction of, the management and policies of any entity or person, whether through ownership of voting securities, contract or otherwise, and "controlled" and "controlling" shall have correlative meanings.

- (d) PERMITTED USES OF TRADE SECRETS. Misappropriation of a trade secret of the Company or any Affiliate in breach of this Agreement may subject Executive to liability under the Defend Trade Secrets Actof2016 (the 'DTSA'), entitle such parties to injunctive relief, and require Executive to pay compensatory damages, double damages, and attorneys' fees. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Executive hereby is notified in accordance with the DTSA that Executive will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made (a) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, in each case solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Executive is further notified that if Executive files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company or any Affiliate for reporting a suspected violation of law, Executive may disclose such entity's trade secrets to Executive's attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if Executive files any document containing the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret except pursuant to court order.



# (e) CONFIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE TO GOVERNMENTAL AND QUASI-

GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits or restricts Executive from reporting possible violations of federal, state, or local law  or  regulation  to,  or  discussing  any  such  possible  violations  with,  any  governmental  agency  or  entity  or  self-regulatory  organization,  including  by initiating communications directly with, responding to any inquiry from, or providing testimony before any federal, state, or local regulatory authority or agency  or  self-regulatory  organization,  including  without  limitation  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity Commission, FINRA, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or making any other disclosures that are protected by the whistleblower provisions of any federal, state, or local law or regulation.

By notice given to Executive at least nine months before the end of the one-year periods referred to in Sections 8(b) and (c)(i), Company may extend such periods for up to an additional year, as long as the Company pays the monthly Base Salary, as referred to in Section 6(b)(ii)(A)(l) whether employment was terminated pursuant to any of Sections 5(c). 5(d) or 5(e).



## (g) INVENTIONS.


- (i)    Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, designs, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, developments, technology, works of authorship, and all work product of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether patentable or unpatentable, (A) that relate to the business, products, activities, research, or development of the Company or Executive's work with the Company, made or conceived or developed by Executive, solely or jointly with others, during the Employment Term, or (B) that arise from any work that Executive performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive's duties with the Company or on Executive's own time, and all rights therein including without limitation in claims related thereto (all of the foregoing 'Inventions') shall belong exclusively to the Company (or its designee), whether or not patent applications are filed thereon. Executive hereby irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and all intellectual property, proprietary, and other

---

# Page 102

rights  therein,  including  without  limitation  all  rights  in  and  to  any  patents,  copyright  registrations,  trademark  registrations,  or  other  forms  of protection that may issue thereon in any and all countries, whether during or subsequent to the Employment Term, together with the right to file, in Executive's name or in the name of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and other rights and registrations (the 'Applications'). Executive will, at the Company's sole cost and expense and at any time during and subsequent to the Employment Term, make such applications, sign such papers, take all rightful oaths, and perform all acts as may be requested from time to time by the Company with respect to the Inventions including  without  limitation  to  the  perfection,  registration,  maintenance,  or  enforcement  of  any  rights  therein.  Executive  will  also  execute assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the Applications, and give the Company and its attorneys all reasonable assistance (including the giving of testimony) to obtain the Inventions and all intellectual property, proprietary, and other rights therein for the Company's benefit, all without additional  compensation  to  Executive  from  the  Company,  but  entirely  at  the  Company's  expense.  Executive  hereby  irrevocably  designates  and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as Executive's agent and attorney in fact, to act for and in Executive's behalf and stead to execute any documents and to do all other lawfully permitted acts in connection with the foregoing, if the Company is unable for any other reason to secure Executive's signature on any document for this purpose.

(ii)    In addition, Executive acknowledges that the Inventions are and will be deemed "work made for hire", as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are not or are deemed not to be "works made for hire", Executive hereby irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company, all rights, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity, in and to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all of Executive's right, title and interest in the copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property and proprietary rights (and all renewals, revivals and extensions thereof) in or to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature now or hereafter recognized, including, without limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the Inventions, to exploit and allow others to exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any infringement, or other unauthorized use or conduct in derogation of the Inventions or any intellectual property or other proprietary rights therein, known or unknown, including without limitation prior to the date hereof, including, without limitation, the right to receive all proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition, Executive hereby waives any so-called "moral rights" with respect to the Inventions. To the extent that Executive has any rights in the results and proceeds of Executive's service to the Company that cannot be assigned in the manner described herein, Executive agrees to and hereby does unconditionally waive the enforcement of such rights. Executive hereby waives any and all currently existing and future monetary rights in and to the Inventions and all patents, copyright registrations, trademark registrations, and other forms of protection that may issue thereon, including, without limitation, any rights that would otherwise accrue to Executive's benefit by virtue of Executive being an employee of or other service provider to the Company.

- (iii)    Solely to the extent that Executive (i) was or is an employee of the Company and (ii) was or is based in the state of Washington or any other state that has enacted laws concerning employee non-assignability of inventions, or otherwise entitled to the benefits of the state statutes of Washington or any other state that has enacted Jaws concerning employee non-assignability of inventions, during the Employment Term, then, to the extent the assignment of Inventions to the Company in this Section 8(g) can be construed to cover inventions excluded under the appropriate state statutes (including, but not limited to, Revised Code of Washington Section 49.44.140(1), the full terms of which is set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto and which is incorporated herein by reference), Sections 8(g)(i) and (ii) shall not apply to such inventions.

Executive represents and warrants that she does not possess or own any rights in or to any confidential, proprietary or non-public information or intellectual property related to the business of the Company. Executive shall comply with all relevant agreements, policies and guidelines of the Company regarding the protection of confidential information and intellectual property and potential conflicts of interest, provided the same are consistent with the terms of this Agreement and Executive's duties to the Company and its Affiliates.

Executive further covenants that Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the covenants set forth in this Section 8, and that Executive will reimburse the Company and its Affiliates for all costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Section 8 if either the Company and/or any of its Affiliates prevails on any material issue involved in such dispute.

- (k) TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Section 8, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-termination restrictions contained in this Section 8 shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any period of such violation.

Upon the receipt of reasonable notice from the Company (including outside counsel), Executive agrees that while employed by the Company and thereafter, Executive will respond and provide information with regard to matters in which Executive has knowledge as a result of Executive's employment with the Company, and will provide reasonable assistance to the Company, its Affiliates and their respective representatives in defense of any claims that may be made against the Company or its Affiliates, and will assist the Company and its Affiliates in the prosecution of any claims that may be made by the Company or its Affiliates, to the extent that such claims may relate to the period of Executive's employment with the Company (collectively, the 'Claims'), all at the Company's sole cost and expense. Executive agrees to promptly inform the Board if Executive becomes aware of any lawsuits involving Claims that may be filed or threatened against the Company or its Affiliates. Executive also agrees to promptly inform the Board (to the extent that Executive is legally permitted to do so) if Executive is asked to assist in any investigation of the Company or its Affiliates (or their actions) or another party attempts to obtain information or documents from Executive (other than in connection with any litigation or other proceeding in which Executive is a party-in-opposition) with respect to matters Executive believes io good faith to relate to any investigation of the Company or its

- 17.    MISCELLANEOUS. No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by Executive and such officer or director as may be designated by the Board.

or understandings (including, without limitation, the offer letter dated February 15, 2022 (the 'Former Agreement') and the Company and its subsidiaries shall have no liability with respect to the Former Agreement) between Executive and the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to the subject matter hereof;  provided  that  in  the  event  that  Executive  becomes  a  party  to  any  other  agreement  providing  for  restrictive  covenants  similar  to  Section  8,  such agreement shall also apply pursuant to its terms. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement.


- 18.    REPRESENTATIONS. Executive represents and warrants to the Company that (a) Executive has the legal right to enter into this Agreement and to perform all of the obligations on Executive's part to be performed hereunder in accordance with its terms, and (b) Executive is not a party toany agreement or understanding, written or oral, and is not subject to any restriction, which, in either case, could prevent Executive from entering into this Agreement or impede Executive from performing all of Executive's duties and obligations hereunder.



# 19. TAX MATTERS.


- (a) WITHHOLDING. The Company may withhold from any and all amounts payable under this Agreement or otherwise such federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. In the event that the Company fails to withhold any taxes required to be withheld by applicable law or regulation, Executive agrees to indemnify the Company for any amount paid with respect to any such taxes, together with any interest, penalty and/or expense related thereto.



## (b) SECTION 409A COMPLIANCE.


- (i)    The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Intemal Revenue Code Section 409A and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively 'Code Section 409A') and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. In no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty that may be imposed on Executive by Code Section 409A or damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A.
- (ii)    A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a "separation from service" within the meaning of Code Section 409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a "termination," "termination of employment" or like terms shall mean "separation from service." Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Executive is deemed on the date of termination to be a "specified employee" within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is considered deferred compensation under Code Section 409A payable on account of a "separation from service," such payment or benefit shall not be made or provided until the date which is the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured

---

# Page 108

from the date of such "separation from service" of Executive, and (B) the date of Executive's death, to the extent required under Code Section 409A. Upon the expiration of the foregoing delay period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section I9(b)(ii) (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed to Executive in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.


- (iii)    To the extent that reimbursements or other in-kind benefits under this Agreement constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" for purposes of Code Section 409A, (A) all such expenses or other reimbursements hereunder shall be made on or prior to the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such expenses were incurred by Executive, (B) any right to such reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, and (C) no such reimbursement, expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided in any taxable year shall in any way affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year.
- (iv)    For purposes of Code Section 409A, Executive's right to receive any installment payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days, the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.
- (v)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any payment under this Agreement that constitutes "nonqualified deferred compensation" for purposes of Code Section 409A be subject to offset by any other amount unless otherwise permitted by Code Section 409A.

## PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT GRANT NOTICE AND AGREEMENT

Holley Inc. (the ' Company '), pursuant to its 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as may be amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the ' Plan '), hereby grants to Holder the number of performance-vesting Restricted Stock Units set forth below, each performance-vesting Restricted Stock Unit being a notional unit representing the right to receive one share of Stock, subject to adjustment as provided in the Plan (the ' Performance Stock Units '). The Performance Stock Units are subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in this Performance Stock Unit Grant Notice and Agreement (this ' Award Agreement '), as well as all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, all of which are incorporated herein in their entirety. To the extent that any provisions herein (or portion thereof) conflicts with any provision of the Plan, the Plan shall prevail and control. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Plan.

Target Number of Performance Stock Units :

Vesting Schedule:

The Performance Stock Units will be one hundred percent (100%) unvested as of the Date of Grant. Subject to the Holder's continued Service Relationship (as defined below) with the Company through the Vesting Date (as defined on Exhibit A attached hereto), the Performance Stock Units shall vest on the Vesting Date based on the Company's achievement of the performance goal(s) set forth and described on Exhibit A hereto. For purposes of this Award Agreement, the term ' Service Relationship ' means any relationship as a full-time or part-time employee, officer, non- employee director, consultant or advisor of the Company or any successor entity ( e.g. , a Service Relationship shall be deemed to continue without interruption in the event an individual's status changes from full-time employee to part-time employee or consultant).

Settlement:

Upon vesting of a Performance Stock Unit, the Company shall settle each Performance Stock Unit by delivering to Holder one share of Stock for each Performance Stock Unit that vested as soon as practicable (but not more than thirty (30) days) following each vesting date (the ' Original Issuance Date '). The shares of Stock issued in respect of the Performance Stock Units may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee shall determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Original Issuance Date does not occur (i) during an 'open window period' applicable to Holder, (ii) on a date when Holder is permitted to sell shares of Stock pursuant to a written plan that meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, as determined by the Company in accordance with the Company's then-effective policy on trading in Company securities (the ' Policy '), or (iii) on a date when Holder is otherwise permitted to sell shares of Stock on an established stock exchange or stock market, then such shares will not be delivered on such Original Issuance Date and will instead be delivered on the first business day of the next occurring 'open window' period applicable to Holder pursuant to such Policy (regardless of whether Holder has experienced a Termination at such time) or the next business day when Holder is not prohibited from selling shares of Stock on the open market, but in no event later than the later of (x) December 31st of the calendar year in which the Original Issuance Date occurs (that is, the last day of Holder's taxable year in which the Original Issuance Date occurs), or (y) to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A- 1(b)(4) without penalty, the fifteenth (15th) day of the third calendar month of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Original Issuance Date occurs.

In the event of Holder's Termination for any reason, all unvested Performance Stock Units shall be cancelled and forfeited as of the date of such Termination for no consideration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Transfer Restrictions:      | Holder shall not be permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, or otherwise encumber the Performance Stock Units before they vest and are settled, and any attempt to sell, transfer, pledge, or otherwise encumber the Performance Stock Units in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| No Rights as a Stockholder: | Neither the Performance Stock Units nor this Award Agreement shall entitle Holder to any voting rights or other rights as a stockholder of the Company unless and until the shares of Stock in respect of the Performance Stock Units have been issued in settlement thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no dividends (whether in cash or shares of Stock) or dividend equivalents shall accrue or be paid with respect to any Performance Stock Units.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Restrictive Covenants:      | Confidential Information.  Holder acknowledges and agrees that the information, observations and data obtained by Holder while employed by the Company or its Affiliates (or by the Person(s) which operated the Company's business prior to the acquisition thereof by the Company and its Affiliates, if applicable) concerning the business or affairs of the Company or any of its Affiliates (' Confidential Information ') shall be the property of the Company or such Affiliate. Therefore, Holder agrees that Holder shall not disclose to any unauthorized Person or use for Holder's own purposes any Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Committee, unless and to the extent that (i) such information becomes generally known to and available for use by the public other than as a result of Holder's acts or omissions, or (ii) such information is required to be disclosed by law, court order or other legal process; provided, in the case of clause (ii) above, that Holder shall provide the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure of such Confidential Information and cooperate with the Company, at the Company's expense, in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such Confidential Information; provided, further, in the case of clause (ii) above, that Holder shall only disclose such Confidential Information that is explicitly required by applicable law, court order or other legal process, as determined by legal counsel, at the Company's expense. Holder shall deliver to the Company on the date of any Termination, or at any other time the Company may request, all memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, computer tapes, printouts and software and other documents and data (and copies thereof) relating to the Confidential Information, Work Product (as defined below) or the business of the Company or any Affiliate which Holder may then possess or have under Holder's control. |

Under the Act, persons who disclose trade secrets in connection with lawsuits or other proceedings under seal (including lawsuits alleging retaliation), or in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, or attorney, solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, enjoy immunity from civil and criminal liability under state and federal trade secrets laws for such disclosure. Holder acknowledges that Holder has hereby received adequate notice of this immunity, such that the Company and its Affiliates are entitled to all remedies available for violations of the Act, including exemplary damages and attorney fees. Nothing in this Award Agreement is intended to conflict with the Act or create liability for disclosures of trade secrets that are expressly allowed by the Act.

Inventions, Etc. Holder agrees that all inventions, innovations, improvements, developments, methods, techniques, processes, algorithms, data, databases, designs, analyses, drawings, reports, and all similar or related information, all software, copyrights, and other works of authorship, all other intellectual property or proprietary rights (including any patents, registrations or similar rights that may issue from the foregoing), and all tangible embodiments of any of the foregoing (in any form or medium, whether now known or hereafter existing), which relate to the Company's or any of its Affiliates' actual or anticipated business, research and development or existing or future products or services and which are conceived, developed, contributed to or made by Holder while employed by the Company or its Affiliates (or by the Person(s) which operated the Company's business prior to the acquisition thereof by the Company and its subsidiaries, if applicable) (collectively, ' Work Product '), belong to and are the property of the Company or such Affiliate, as applicable, and Holder hereby assigns to the Company or such Affiliate, as applicable, any right, title and interest Holder may have in and to the Work Product, free and clear of any claims for compensation or restrictions on the use or ownership thereof. Holder will promptly disclose such Work Product to the Committee and perform all actions reasonably requested by the Committee (whether before or after the Holder's Termination) to establish, record, perfect and otherwise confirm such ownership, and protect, maintain and enforce the Company's and the Affiliate's rights in such Work Product (including, without limitation, by executing assignments, consents, powers of attorney, and other instruments and providing affidavits and testifying in any proceeding).

Non-Compete, Non-Solicitation. Holder acknowledges that during Holder's employment with the Company, Holder has and will become familiar with the Company's trade secrets and with other Confidential Information concerning the Company and its Affiliates and that Holder's services will be of special, unique and extraordinary value to the Company and its Affiliates. Therefore, and in further consideration of the Performance Stock Units to be granted to Holder hereunder, Holder agrees to the covenants set forth in this section and acknowledges that (i) the covenants set forth herein are reasonably limited in time and in all other respects, (ii) the covenants set forth herein are reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company, and (iii) the covenants set forth herein have been made in order to induce the Company to enter into this Award Agreement and the Company would not have entered into this Award Agreement but for Holder's agreement to such covenants.

Holder agrees that, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the two year anniversary of Holder's Termination (the ' Restricted Period '), Holder shall not directly or indirectly own any interest in, manage, control, engage in, participate in, consult with, contribute to or render services for (as an officer, director, employee or in any other regard), any Person that is in any business which competes with any business that the Company and/or its Affiliates conducts or has specific plans to conduct at the time of Holder's Termination anywhere in the world; provided that, nothing herein shall prohibit Holder from being a passive owner of less than 2% of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation which is publicly traded, so long as Holder has no active participation in the business of such corporation.

During the Restricted Period, Holder shall not directly, or indirectly through another entity, (i) solicit or induce or attempt to solicit or induce any employee of the Company or any Affiliate to leave the employ of the Company or such Affiliate, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and any employee thereof, (ii) hire any person who was an employee of the Company or any Affiliate at any time from 6 months prior to the date hereof through the Holder's Termination, (iii) make any statement or do any act intended to cause existing or potential customers of the Company or any Affiliate to make use of the services or purchase the products of any competitive business or (iv) induce or attempt to induce any customer, supplier, licensee, licensor, franchisee or other business relation of the Company or any Affiliate to cease doing business with, or materially and adversely change the terms of its business with, the Company or such Affiliate, or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such customer, supplier, licensee, licensor, franchisee or business relation and the Company or any Affiliate.


If the Committee determines in good faith that Holder has breached or threatened to breach any of the covenants contained herein, or any restrictive covenant contained in an employment agreement or other agreement between Holder and any of the Company or any of its Affiliates, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
- (a)   any unvested or vested but unsettled Performance Stock Units shall be immediately forfeited effective as of the date of such breach, unless sooner terminated by operation of another term or condition of this Award Agreement or the Plan, and Holder shall deliver to the Company (or take all steps necessary to effectuate the delivery of), no later than five (5) days following such determination, any shares of Stock issued upon the settlement of Holder's Performance Stock Units and any proceeds resulting from the sale or other disposition (including to the Company) of shares of Stock issued upon settlement of Holder's Performance Stock Units; and
- (b)   Holder hereby consents and agrees that the Company shall be entitled to seek, in addition to other available remedies, a temporary or permanent injunction or other equitable relief against such breach or threatened breach from any court of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of showing any actual damages or that money damages would not afford an adequate remedy, and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security. The aforementioned equitable relief shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, legal remedies, monetary damages or other available forms of relief. Each of the Company's Affiliates not party to this Award Agreement is intended to be third-party beneficiaries of the provisions of the restrictive covenants set forth herein, and such provisions may be enforced by each of them in accordance with the terms hereof in respect of the rights granted to each such entity hereunder.


It is expressly understood and agreed that, if a final judicial determination is made by a court having jurisdiction (without regard to any ability to appeal or whether an appeal is in fact taken, during the pendency of that appeal) that the time or territory restrictions or any other provision herein related to the restrictive covenants is an unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable restriction against Holder, the provisions herein related to the restrictive covenants shall not be rendered void, but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such other extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be reasonable.

Holder acknowledges and agrees that the provisions herein related to the restrictive covenants shall continue to apply following Holder's Termination, regardless of the reason for such Termination.
