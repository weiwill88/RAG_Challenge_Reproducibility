I need to examine the provided text, specifically looking for mentions of share buybacks, share repurchases, or Normal Course Issuer Bids (NCIBs).\n3. The text contains several sections discussing share repurchases. Page 3 mentions completing an NCIB and a pro rata share repurchase in 2022. Page 19 and 68 detail two NCIB programs, one completed in 2021 and another completed in May 2022. These sections report on past announcements and activities.\n4. Page 20 and 68 describe a significant share repurchase conducted via a Plan of Arrangement, which was approved in August 2022 and completed in October 2022. This was a specific, one-time event.\n5. The report *reports* on these share buyback activities that occurred during the fiscal year 2022 (and compared to 2021). It describes plans that were previously announced and executed. However, there is no statement or section in the report announcing a *new* share buyback plan (like a new NCIB program or a future repurchase initiative) that would commence after the date of the report (February 14, 2023).\n6. Therefore, while the report discusses past and completed share buyback plans, it does not announce a *new* share buyback plan within the report itself for the future.",

I need to review the provided text extracts and look for terms related to corporate transactions such as 'merger', 'acquisition', 'acquired', 'business combination', 'divestiture', or similar concepts.\n3. On page 5, the 'About Us' section explicitly mentions strategic acquisitions made by the company in 2022, 2021, and 2020, listing specific acquired entities like John's, SKC, RaceQuip, AEM, Classic Instruments, ADS, Baer, Brothers, Rocket, Speartech, Simpson, Drake, and Detroit Speed.\n4. On page 6, the 'Business Strategy' section mentions 'Accelerate Growth Through Continued M&A' and refers to the 'Business Combination' that occurred on July 16, 2021.\n5. The 'Management's Discussion and Analysis' section (starting on page 33) includes sections specifically discussing the 'Business Combination' (page 33) and 'Acquisitions' (page 34), detailing the strategy and listing significant acquisitions.\n6. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements (starting on page 63) is titled 'BUSINESS COMBINATION, ACQUISITIONS, AND DIVESTITURE' and provides extensive details about the 2021 Business Combination, the acquisitions made in 2022 and 2021, and a divestiture in 2022.\n7.
